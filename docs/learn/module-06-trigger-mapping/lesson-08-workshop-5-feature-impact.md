# Lesson 7: Workshop 5 - Feature Impact

**Saga Analyzes and Scores Your Features**

---

## Overview

Workshop 5 is where strategy becomes actionable roadmap. With your business goals, target groups, driving forces, and priorities established in Workshops 1-4, Saga now has everything needed to evaluate your features. Saga analyzes each feature against your top prioritized drivers and produces a complete scoring matrix automatically.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes
**Format:** Saga presents analysis, you review and discuss
**Output:** Scored and ranked feature list with strategic justification

---

## How It Works

### 1. You Provide the Feature List

**Give Saga your feature ideas:**
- Ideas from Product Brief
- Stakeholder requests
- Competitive features
- User feedback
- Team suggestions

**Aim for:** 10-20 features for evaluation

### 2. Saga Does the Analysis

**Saga evaluates each feature automatically:**
- Assesses how well each feature addresses your top 5-7 drivers
- Applies consistent 0-3 scoring scale
- Considers both direct and indirect impacts
- Produces complete scoring matrix

**Scoring scale Saga uses:**
- **3** = Directly addresses this driver (core solution)
- **2** = Significantly helps with this driver
- **1** = Somewhat related to this driver
- **0** = Doesn't address this driver

### 3. Saga Presents the Results

**You receive:**
- Complete scoring matrix showing all evaluations
- Total scores for each feature
- Initial roadmap prioritization
- Strategic reasoning for each score

### 4. You Review and Discuss

**Conversation-based refinement:**
- Saga explains surprising scores
- You can challenge or question assessments
- Saga adjusts based on your strategic judgment
- Final roadmap emerges from discussion

---

## How Saga Evaluates Features

### During Analysis

**Saga considers for each feature:**
- How directly does this address each prioritized driver?
- Does this create gain or reduce pain for the persona?
- What's the magnitude of impact on each driver?
- Are there both direct and indirect benefits?
- Which drivers get the strongest support?

**Saga applies strategic thinking:**
- Traces features back to psychological drivers
- Evaluates emotional impact, not just functionality
- Considers both positive and negative drivers
- Assesses strategic leverage across multiple drivers

### During Review Discussion

**Questions you might ask Saga:**
- "Why did [feature] score higher/lower than I expected?"
- "Can you explain the reasoning behind this score?"
- "What would make this feature score higher?"
- "Are we missing features that would score better?"
- "How would modifying this feature affect its scores?"

**Saga's helpful prompts:**
- "I scored this low because it doesn't address your top drivers. Here's why..."
- "This feature scored high across multiple drivers. Let me show you..."
- "If we adjusted this feature like this, it could score higher..."
- "Based on your drivers, here's a gap I'm seeing..."

## Generic Example: Scoring Matrix

### Context

**Top 5 Prioritized Drivers (Remote Team Leads):**
1. Fear of team burnout without noticing (NEGATIVE)
2. Want to demonstrate effective leadership (POSITIVE)
3. Fear of losing top performers (NEGATIVE)
4. Want to build strong team culture (POSITIVE)
5. Fear of missed deadlines (NEGATIVE)

### Features to Score

| Feature | Burnout Fear | Leadership | Retention | Culture | Deadlines | **Total** |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Daily team pulse check | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | **9** |
| Team workload dashboard | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 2 | **9** |
| Recognition system | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | **7** |
| 1-on-1 scheduling assistant | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | **6** |
| Meeting summaries | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | **4** |
| Async video updates | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | **4** |
| Team chat | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | **3** |

### Detailed Scoring Example

**Feature: Daily Team Pulse Check**

**Against "Fear of team burnout without noticing" (Score: 3)**
- Directly addresses the fear
- Provides daily visibility into team health
- Early warning system for burnout indicators
- Core solution to the problem

**Against "Want to demonstrate effective leadership" (Score: 2)**
- Provides data to show proactive management
- Enables evidence-based leadership decisions
- Significantly helps but not the primary purpose

**Against "Fear of losing top performers" (Score: 2)**
- Early warning helps prevent burnout-driven turnover
- Identifies at-risk team members
- Significantly helps with retention

**Against "Want to build strong team culture" (Score: 1)**
- Shows you care about team wellbeing
- Somewhat related but not primary benefit

**Against "Fear of missed deadlines" (Score: 1)**
- Can identify capacity issues early
- Somewhat helps but not main purpose

**Total: 9 points** (Highest strategic impact)

---

**Feature: Team Chat**

**Against "Fear of team burnout" (Score: 0)**
- Doesn't address burnout visibility
- No impact on this driver

**Against "Want to demonstrate leadership" (Score: 0)**
- Doesn't provide leadership insights
- No impact on this driver

**Against "Fear of losing performers" (Score: 1)**
- Helps with connection (minor retention factor)

**Against "Fear of missed deadlines" (Score: 0)**
- Doesn't address deadline management
- No impact on this driver

**Total: 3 points** (Low strategic impact for this persona)

---

## Prioritized Roadmap

Based on scores, create phases:

### Phase 1: Highest Impact (8-10 points)
- Daily team pulse check (9)
- Team workload dashboard (9)

**Why first:** Directly address top fears, highest strategic value

### Phase 2: High Impact (6-7 points)
- Recognition system (7)
- 1-on-1 scheduling assistant (6)

**Why second:** Good strategic value, support top priorities

### Phase 3: Medium Impact (4-5 points)
- Meeting summaries (4)
- Async video updates (4)

**Why third:** Some value but lower priority

### Backlog: Low Impact (0-3 points)
- Team chat (3)

**Why backlog:** Doesn't address top strategic drivers for this persona

## Why Saga's Analysis Works Better

### It's Consistently Strategic

**Saga evaluates with perfect traceability:**
- Every score connects to a prioritized driver
- Every driver traces to a target group
- Every group connects to a business goal

**Not arbitrary** - complete strategic chain for every decision

### It's Unbiased and Objective

**Without Saga (traditional approach):**
"I think Feature A is more important" (opinion-based, political)

**With Saga's analysis:**
"Feature A scores 9, Feature B scores 4 because..." (data-driven, defensible)

**Saga doesn't have pet features or political pressures**

### It's Fast and Thorough

**Manual scoring:**
- Takes hours with spreadsheets
- Easy to miss connections
- Inconsistent application of criteria
- Tedious and error-prone

**Saga's automated analysis:**
- Complete matrix in minutes
- Considers all driver relationships
- Consistent scoring methodology
- You focus on strategic discussion, not data entry

### It's Defensible to Stakeholders

**When asked "Why aren't we building Feature X?"**

**Saga's analysis provides:**
1. The complete Trigger Map context
2. Top prioritized drivers from Workshop 4
3. Detailed scoring matrix with reasoning
4. Feature X's lower strategic impact shown clearly

**Strategic reasoning backed by systematic analysis**

### It's Adaptable

**When priorities shift:**
- Update driver rankings in Saga
- Saga re-analyzes all features instantly
- New roadmap emerges automatically
- No manual re-scoring needed

**Strategy drives features, with Saga maintaining consistency**

## How Saga Scores (And How You Review)

### Saga's Scoring Principles

**Saga evaluates objectively:**
- No pet features or political bias
- Based purely on strategic fit to drivers
- Applies consistent methodology across all features
- Some features will naturally score low - that's valuable data

**Saga is specific:**
- Links each score to concrete driver impact
- Explains HOW a feature addresses (or doesn't address) each driver
- Provides reasoning you can challenge or validate

### Your Role: Strategic Validation

**When reviewing Saga's scores:**
- Challenge assessments that feel wrong
- Provide context Saga might have missed
- Explain strategic factors not yet captured
- Confirm or adjust based on your domain knowledge

**Example exchange:**
> **You:** "I'm surprised the chat feature scored so low."
> **Saga:** "It scored 3 total because it only addresses 'build team culture' (score: 2) and retention (score: 1), but doesn't impact your top three drivers: burnout visibility, leadership demonstration, or deadline concerns. Should we reconsider its strategic fit?"

### Understanding the Scale

**How Saga uses 0-3:**
- **3** = Rare - only core solutions to that specific driver
- **2** = Significant help, clear connection
- **1** = Some relationship, indirect benefit
- **0** = Common - not every feature addresses every driver

**Most scores land at 0-2, which is healthy**

### Positive and Negative Drivers

**Saga evaluates both:**
- Negative drivers: Does this reduce pain or prevent fears?
- Positive drivers: Does this enable goals or create gains?
- High-impact features often address both types

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: High Scores Across Multiple Drivers

**What it means:** High-leverage feature addressing multiple needs

**Example:** Daily pulse check scores high on burnout fear, leadership goals, retention fear

**Action:** Prioritize - strategically valuable

### Pattern 2: High Score on Top Driver Only

**What it means:** Laser-focused solution for most important need

**Example:** Workload balancing scores 3 on burnout fear, low on others

**Action:** Still high priority if that driver is #1

### Pattern 3: Moderate Scores Across Many

**What it means:** Nice-to-have that helps a bit with everything

**Example:** Team chat scores 1-2 on multiple drivers

**Action:** Lower priority - not solving urgent problems

### Pattern 4: Low Scores Everywhere

**What it means:** Feature doesn't connect to strategy

**Example:** Fancy animations score 0-1 across all drivers

**Action:** Cut it or deprioritize significantly

## Beyond the Numbers: The Review Discussion

### Why the Conversation Matters

**Reviewing Saga's analysis reveals insights:**

When you ask: "Why doesn't this feature score higher?"
→ Saga shows the strategic gap clearly
→ You might modify the feature to increase impact
→ Or you accept it's not strategically aligned right now

When you ask: "Are we missing features that would score higher?"
→ Saga analyzes the driver coverage
→ Identifies gaps in your feature set
→ Suggests feature concepts that would address unmet drivers

When you ask: "This score doesn't match my intuition. Why?"
→ Either your strategy needs refinement
→ Or Saga missed context you can provide
→ The discussion sharpens your strategic clarity

**The analysis is data. The discussion creates wisdom.**

### Combining Strategic Impact with Other Factors

**Saga's scores = Strategic value (from Trigger Map)**

**You also consider:**
- **Feasibility:** How hard to build?
- **Dependencies:** What's required first?
- **Market timing:** Competitive urgency?
- **Resources:** Do we have capacity?

**Combined decision formula:**
```
Priority = (Saga's Strategic Impact × Feasibility) + Urgency Factors
```

High strategic impact + easy to build = Phase 1
High strategic impact + hard to build = Phased approach
Low strategic impact (regardless of ease) = Backlog or cut

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Providing Enough Context

**Problem:** Giving Saga feature names without explaining what they do
**Why it fails:** Saga can't evaluate strategic fit without understanding the feature
**Fix:** Briefly explain each feature's purpose and how it works

### Mistake 2: Not Challenging Scores You Disagree With

**Problem:** Accepting Saga's analysis without discussion
**Why it fails:** Misses opportunities to refine strategic thinking
**Fix:** Question surprising scores - the discussion reveals insights

### Mistake 3: Overriding Scores for Political Reasons

**Problem:** "Boss wants Feature X, let's bump it up"
**Why it fails:** Defeats the purpose of strategic analysis
**Fix:** Use Saga's objective analysis to have strategic conversations with stakeholders

### Mistake 4: Analyzing Too Many Features at Once

**Problem:** Trying to score 50+ features in one session
**Why it fails:** Analysis fatigue, loses strategic focus
**Fix:** Start with 10-20 most viable features, expand later

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Low-Scoring Features

**Problem:** "But we still need to build it even though it scored low"
**Why it fails:** Wastes resources on strategically misaligned features
**Fix:** Accept that low scores mean deprioritize or cut - that's valuable clarity

### Mistake 6: Never Re-Running the Analysis

**Problem:** Using stale scores as strategy evolves
**Why it fails:** Roadmap doesn't reflect current priorities
**Fix:** Re-run Saga's analysis when priorities shift (takes minutes, not hours)

### Mistake 7: Forgetting Feasibility

**Problem:** Prioritizing impossible or extremely difficult features
**Why it fails:** Can't actually execute the roadmap
**Fix:** Combine Saga's strategic scores with feasibility assessment

## Using Saga's Scored Feature List

### For Sprint Planning

**Each sprint:**
- Reference Saga's scored list
- Focus on highest-impact features first
- Validate decisions against the Trigger Map
- Make trade-offs based on strategic data, not opinions

**When questioned:**
"Why are we building this instead of that?" → Show Saga's scoring matrix

### For Stakeholder Communication

**When presenting roadmap:**
1. Show the Trigger Map (strategic foundation)
2. Show Saga's scoring matrix (systematic analysis)
3. Show the prioritized list (data-driven roadmap)
4. Walk through the strategic reasoning

**Stakeholders respond well to:**
- Clear, systematic methodology
- Traceable decisions (not "because I think so")
- Strategic foundation (connects to business goals)
- Objective analysis (Saga's unbiased evaluation)

**You have strategic armor against political pressure**

### For Design Decisions

**When Freya starts design work:**
- She references Saga's scored list
- Focuses on high-impact features first
- Understands which drivers each feature must address
- Validates design decisions against the scoring

**Example conversation with Freya:**
> "We're designing the pulse check (Saga scored it 9). It addresses 'fear of burnout' (score: 3), so it needs early warning indicators and actionable suggestions. That's what makes it high-impact."

**Design decisions trace back to psychological drivers through Saga's analysis**
