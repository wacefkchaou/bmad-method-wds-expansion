# Lesson 5: Workshop 3 - Driving Forces

**Saga Helps You Map the Psychology That Drives Behavior**

---

## Overview

Workshop 3 is where Saga guides you to uncover the psychological drivers for each persona - both what they want to achieve and what they want to avoid. Through thoughtful conversation, Saga draws out the emotional core of what actually drives user behavior.

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes
**Format:** Guided dialog with Saga (exploring one persona at a time)
**Output:** Complete psychological profile for each persona (positive + negative drivers, documented by Saga)

---

## How the Guided Dialog Works

### Saga Explores Two Types of Drivers for Each Persona

**For each persona from Workshop 2, Saga helps you identify:**

**Positive Drivers (GAIN) - What they're moving TOWARD:**

Through conversation, Saga draws out what they want to achieve, what benefits they're seeking, what goals pull them forward, and what positive outcomes motivate them.

**Negative Drivers (PAIN) - What they're moving AWAY FROM:**

Saga explores what they want to avoid, what frustrates them, what fears push them to act, and what problems they're trying to escape.

**The key insight Saga emphasizes:** Both matter, but negative drivers often create more urgent action due to loss aversion. Saga will help you uncover both types.

---

## Saga's Conversational Approach

### How Saga Uncovers Psychological Drivers

**Saga works through each persona individually,** exploring their psychology deeply before moving to the next. She starts with positive drivers (aspirations), then shifts to negative drivers (fears and frustrations).

**Opening questions about positive drivers (GAIN):**
> **Saga:** "Let's explore what Remote Team Leads want to achieve. When they face managing a distributed team, what are they hoping for?"
> **You:** "They want to keep everyone productive..."
> **Saga:** "What does 'productive' mean to them emotionally? What would that accomplish?"
> **You:** "I guess... they want to look like they're doing a good job as a leader..."
> **Saga:** "So there's a want to demonstrate effective leadership. Tell me more about that..."

**Saga's questions that dig into positive drivers:**
- "What are they hoping to accomplish?"
- "What would success look like emotionally, not just functionally?"
- "What goals are pulling them forward?"
- "Why does that matter to them personally?"
- "What benefits would they value most?"

**Shifting to negative drivers (PAIN):**
> **Saga:** "Now let's flip to what they're trying to avoid. What are Remote Team Leads afraid might happen?"
> **You:** "Well, they can't see their team members face-to-face..."
> **Saga:** "And what's the fear in that?"
> **You:** "That someone could be really struggling and they wouldn't know..."
> **Saga:** "And if that happened - someone burning out without them noticing - how would they feel?"
> **You:** "Terrible. Guilty. Like they failed as a manager."
> **Saga:** "So there's a fear of team burnout without noticing, connected to guilt and professional failure. That's powerful. What else do they fear?"

**Saga's questions that uncover negative drivers:**
- "What keeps them up at night about this?"
- "What are they trying to avoid?"
- "What would be embarrassing or costly if it happened?"
- "What frustrates them about how things work now?"
- "What do they fear will happen if they don't solve this?"

**Saga digs deeper into emotional intensity:**
- "Why does that matter to them emotionally? What's the feeling?"
- "How intense is this driver? Is it a constant worry or occasional concern?"
- "What's the deeper fear or desire behind what you just said?"
- "That sounds a bit generic - can you be more specific about the emotional core?"
- "On a scale of 1-5, how much does this drive their behavior?"

### Saga's Facilitation Techniques

**Like BMad v6, Saga:**
- **One persona at a time** - Completes psychological profile before moving on
- **Positive then negative** - Explores aspirations before fears
- **Reflects emotional language** - "So you're saying they feel guilty when..."
- **Challenges generic statements** - "What does 'productive' really mean to them?"
- **Seeks emotional core** - "Why does that matter emotionally?"
- **Documents as you discover** - You explore psychology, Saga captures drivers
- **Validates intensity** - "Is this a constant worry or occasional concern?"

## Why Negative Drivers Are More Powerful

### The Psychology: Loss Aversion

Research shows people work roughly **twice as hard to avoid pain as to pursue equivalent gain**.

**Generic examples:**

**Scenario 1: Fitness**
- Positive: "Want to look good for summer" → Weak urgency
- Negative: "Fear health problems like parent had" → Strong urgency
- **Which drives action?** The fear

**Scenario 2: Project Management**
- Positive: "Want to be organized" → Nice to have
- Negative: "Fear missing client deadline and losing contract" → Critical need
- **Which drives adoption?** The fear

**Scenario 3: Email Management**
- Positive: "Want clean inbox" → Low urgency
- Negative: "Fear missing urgent client email" → High urgency
- **Which drives behavior change?** The fear

### The Emotional Core

Negative drivers often connect to powerful emotions:

- **Shame:** "What will people think?"
- **Guilt:** "I'm letting people down"
- **Anxiety:** "What if this goes wrong?"
- **Embarrassment:** "This makes me look bad"
- **Fear:** "I could lose something important"

**These emotions drive urgent action.**

## Balancing Both Types

The most powerful understanding comes from mapping BOTH:

### How They Work Together

**Positive drivers suggest:**
- The aspirational features
- Long-term value propositions
- What makes the experience delightful

**Negative drivers suggest:**
- The urgent, must-have features
- What drives initial adoption
- What prevents churn

**Example: Team Pulse Check Feature**

**Addresses positive drivers:**
- Helps build team culture (shows you care)
- Demonstrates leadership (provides data)

**Addresses negative drivers:**
- Prevents burnout blindness (early warning)
- Avoids looking ineffective (proactive management)

**Why it works:** Solves urgent pain AND delivers aspirational benefit.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Rushing Past Negative Drivers

**Problem:** Spending more time on positive drivers because they feel nicer
**Why it fails:** Saga needs both - negative drivers often have more urgency
**Fix:** Give equal time to exploring fears and frustrations when Saga asks

### Mistake 2: Accepting Generic Statements

**Problem:** Saying "Want to be productive" when Saga asks for deeper emotional core
**Why it fails:** Saga can't build specific psychological profiles from vague wants
**Fix:** When Saga challenges "what does that mean emotionally?" - dig deeper with her

### Mistake 3: Listing Features Instead of Psychology

**Problem:** "Want a calendar feature" when Saga asks about drivers
**Why it fails:** That's a solution, not a psychological driver
**Fix:** When Saga redirects you, describe the emotional need: "Want to never miss family commitments due to work chaos"

### Mistake 4: Skipping Emotional Intensity Discussion

**Problem:** Not engaging when Saga asks "how intense is this driver?"
**Why it fails:** All drivers end up seeming equal, can't prioritize later
**Fix:** Think through intensity honestly with Saga - constant worry vs occasional concern

### Mistake 5: Avoiding Uncomfortable Negative Drivers

**Problem:** Downplaying fears because they feel uncomfortable to discuss
**Why it fails:** Saga needs the real emotional drivers, including fear, shame, guilt
**Fix:** Be honest about negative emotions - Saga knows they're often the most actionable

### Mistake 6: Not Letting Saga Challenge Surface Answers

**Problem:** Accepting your first answer without deeper exploration
**Why it fails:** Miss the real emotional core that drives behavior
**Fix:** When Saga asks follow-ups like "why does that matter emotionally?" - engage with the question

## How This Feeds Into Next Workshops

**Workshop 3 creates the psychological foundation:**

```
Business Goals
    ↓
Target Groups
    ↓
Driving Forces (positive + negative for each group)

Workshop 4: Which drivers are most powerful?
    ↓
Workshop 5: Which features address top drivers?
```

The drivers you map here become the criteria for prioritization and feature scoring.

---

## The Control Question: Validating Your Drivers

Once you've identified the driving forces for each target group, validate them with these critical questions:

### "If This Target Group Feels This Way, Would Our Offering Be the Best Option for Them?"

**What this reveals:**
- Whether your product actually addresses their drivers
- If there's a real fit between their psychology and your solution
- Whether you're solving the right problem

**Example validation:**

**Target Group:** Remote Team Leads  
**Top Driver:** Fear of team burnout without noticing

**Control question:** "If they fear team burnout without noticing, would our daily pulse check be the best option?"

**Validation:**
- ✅ Yes - provides early warning system they lack
- ✅ Addresses the specific fear directly
- ✅ Fits their daily workflow

**If the answer is no or weak:** You may have identified the wrong drivers, or your product doesn't fit this group.

---

### "What Alternatives Do They Have?"

**What this reveals:**
- Competitive landscape from psychological perspective
- Whether your solution is truly differentiated
- What you're really competing against (often not what you think)

**Example analysis:**

**Target Group:** Remote Team Leads  
**Driver:** Fear of team burnout without noticing

**Alternatives they have:**
1. **Manual check-ins** - Time-consuming, inconsistent, relies on people speaking up
2. **Annual surveys** - Too infrequent, backward-looking, no early warning
3. **Gut feeling** - Unreliable, often too late, causes anxiety
4. **Nothing** - Hope for the best, react when crisis hits

**Why our offering is better:**
- Daily automated pulse vs manual effort
- Real-time vs annual
- Data-driven vs gut feeling
- Proactive vs reactive

**If you can't articulate why you're better:** Either the driver isn't strong enough, or your solution doesn't differentiate.

---

### "Why Should They Care in the First Place?"

**What this reveals:**
- Whether the driver has real urgency
- If the pain/gain is significant enough to motivate action
- Whether this is a "nice-to-have" or "must-have"

**Example validation:**

**Target Group:** Remote Team Leads  
**Driver:** Fear of team burnout without noticing

**Why should they care:**
- **Career impact:** Team burnout reflects poorly on their leadership
- **Business impact:** Losing top performers is costly and visible
- **Emotional impact:** Guilt and responsibility for people's wellbeing
- **Immediate consequence:** Can happen without warning, hard to recover from
- **Frequency:** Constant worry, not occasional concern

**Urgency level:** Very high - active fear with career consequences

**If they don't care enough:** The driver may be too weak to motivate product adoption. Look for stronger drivers or different target groups.

---

## Using the Control Questions

### When to Apply Them

**After mapping drivers for each persona:**
1. List all drivers (positive and negative)
2. Apply control questions to top 3-5 drivers
3. Validate fit between drivers and your offering
4. Identify gaps or misalignments

### What to Do with the Answers

**If validation is strong:**
- ✅ Proceed with confidence
- ✅ Use these drivers for prioritization
- ✅ Design features that address them

**If validation is weak:**
- ⚠️ Re-examine the drivers (are they accurate?)
- ⚠️ Consider different target groups
- ⚠️ Adjust your product strategy
- ⚠️ Look for stronger psychological drivers

**If you can't beat alternatives:**
- 🚨 Major red flag - why would they choose you?
- 🚨 Need differentiation or different positioning
- 🚨 May need to pivot target group or offering

### Generic Example: Fitness App

**Target Group:** Busy professionals  
**Driver:** Want to stay healthy despite hectic schedule

**Control questions:**

**1. Would our offering be best option?**
- Our app: 15-minute workouts, no equipment, fits any schedule
- ✅ Yes - specifically designed for time-constrained people

**2. What alternatives do they have?**
- Gym membership (requires travel time, fixed hours)
- YouTube videos (overwhelming choice, no structure)
- Nothing (guilt, declining health)
- Our advantage: Minimal time, structured, no barriers

**3. Why should they care?**
- Health declining, energy low
- Feeling guilty about neglecting fitness
- Want to set good example for kids
- Fear of health problems like parents had
- ✅ Strong urgency - both positive and negative drivers

**Validation:** Strong fit. Proceed with this target group and driver.

## Tips for a Successful Dialog with Saga

**DO:**
- ✅ Give negative drivers equal time - they're often more urgent than positive ones
- ✅ Answer Saga's "why emotionally?" questions honestly - that's where insight lives
- ✅ Use specific examples from real users when describing drivers
- ✅ Engage when Saga asks about intensity - "constant worry" vs "occasional concern" matters
- ✅ Let Saga challenge generic statements - she's helping you think deeper
- ✅ Focus on psychology and emotions, not features or solutions
- ✅ Be honest about uncomfortable drivers - fear, shame, guilt, embarrassment

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Rush through negative drivers because they feel uncomfortable
- ❌ Give surface-level answers like "want to be productive" and stop there
- ❌ List features when Saga asks for psychological drivers
- ❌ Say all drivers are equally important - emotional intensity matters
- ❌ Skip the control questions - Saga uses these to validate fit
- ❌ Stop at your first answer - let Saga's follow-ups reveal deeper insight

---

## What's Next

Workshop 4 prioritizes these drivers - ranking which groups and which psychological drivers matter most. This creates the focus for all design decisions.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Guided psychological exploration** - Saga asks one persona at a time, one driver type at a time
✅ **Two types of drivers** - Positive (gain-seeking) and Negative (pain-avoidance)
✅ **Negative often more powerful** - Saga emphasizes loss aversion creates urgent action
✅ **Emotional core matters** - Saga digs beyond surface wants to find real psychological drivers
✅ **Intensity mapping** - Saga helps you distinguish constant worries from occasional concerns
✅ **Specific not generic** - Saga challenges vague statements until emotional core emerges
✅ **Control questions validate** - Saga uses these to confirm drivers match your offering
✅ **Like BMad v6** - Reflective dialog that reveals deeper psychology than you'd write alone
