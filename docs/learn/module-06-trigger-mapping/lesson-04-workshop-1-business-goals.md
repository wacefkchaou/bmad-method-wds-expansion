# Lesson 3: Workshop 1 - Business Goals

**Saga Guides You to Define What Winning Looks Like**

---

## Overview

Workshop 1 is where Saga helps you articulate the strategic foundation for your entire Trigger Map. Through a guided conversation, Saga draws out both your aspirational vision and the concrete measurable objectives that prove you're succeeding.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes
**Format:** Guided dialog with Saga (one thoughtful question at a time)
**Output:** Vision statement + 3-5 strategic objectives (documented by Saga)

---

## Understanding the Two Levels

Business goals work on two distinct levels:

### 1. Vision (Visionary Statements)

**What it is:**
- Aspirational and motivational
- Grand ambitions that reflect focus and direction
- Not exact or measurable
- Examples: "Be the best," "Fastest in market," "Top of mind"

**Characteristics:**
- Easy to set, hard to measure
- Provides the "why" and emotional drive
- Inspires and motivates the team
- Gives direction without rigid constraints

### 2. Strategic Objectives

**What it is:**
- Specific and measurable (expressed using SMART method)
- Observable evidence that vision is being realized
- Concrete milestones you can track
- Examples: "10,000 users by Q4," "70% retention rate"

**Characteristics:**
- Harder to set, easy to measure
- Provides the "what" and accountability
- Enables progress tracking
- Creates clear success criteria

**Why both matter:** Visionary statements provide motivation and direction. Objectives provide accountability and proof of progress. Together they create both inspiration and measurement.

## How the Guided Dialog Works

### Phase 1: Saga Helps You Articulate Vision

**Saga starts with the big picture:**

Saga asks about your grand ambition - not metrics yet, just the aspirational future state. She listens as you describe what motivates the team and why this project matters.

**Natural conversation flow:**
> **Saga:** "Let's start with the big picture. What's the grand ambition behind this project?"
> **You:** "We want to make remote work sustainable and healthy..."
> **Saga:** "That's compelling. When you say 'sustainable and healthy,' what does that mean to you?"
> **You:** [You elaborate on your thinking]
> **Saga:** "So if I'm hearing you right, you're aiming to..." [reflects back your vision]

**Saga captures your vision statement** as you talk. No forms to fill out.

### Phase 2: Saga Bridges to Observable Reality

**The critical bridging question:**

Once Saga understands your vision, she asks the question that transforms aspiration into measurable reality: **"When this vision is being realized, what will we observe in the world?"**

**Conversation continues:**
> **Saga:** "When remote work is sustainable and healthy, what will we actually see happening?"
> **You:** "Well, teams would be using the tools regularly, staying engaged..."
> **Saga:** "Good - what else? What would prove this is working?"
> **You:** "They'd stick around long-term, maybe grow their usage..."
> **Saga:** "And from a business perspective?"
> **You:** "We'd see revenue that proves the model is viable."

**Saga documents these observations** as you think through them together.

### Phase 3: Saga Helps Define Strategic Objectives

**Converting insights to SMART objectives:**

Now Saga takes what you've described and helps you sharpen it into 3-5 specific, measurable objectives. She asks about numbers, timeframes, and what's realistically achievable.

See [SMART Method Reference](../../models/smart-goals-model.md) for the framework Saga uses.

**Dialog example:**
> **Saga:** "You mentioned teams using it regularly. What does 'regularly' look like in numbers?"
> **You:** "Daily engagement would be ideal..."
> **Saga:** "What's a meaningful daily engagement metric you could track?"
> **You:** "Maybe 15 minutes of active time?"
> **Saga:** "Perfect. So one objective could be: 'Increase average session time to 15 minutes daily.' Does that capture it?"

**Saga documents each objective** in proper SMART format as you refine them together.

**Example final objectives:**
1. Achieve 5,000 active teams by Q4 2024
2. Increase average session time to 15 minutes daily
3. Reach 70% weekly retention rate
4. Generate $50K MRR by end of year

## Saga's Conversational Approach

### Questions Saga Asks (One at a Time)

**Saga doesn't interrogate - she guides.** Each question builds naturally on what you just said. She listens deeply, reflects back your thinking, and helps you articulate what you already know but haven't fully expressed.

**Opening questions about vision:**
- "What's the grand ambition behind this project?"
- "When you say [your words], what does that really mean to you?"
- "What motivates your team about this?"
- "Why does this matter right now?"

**The critical bridging question:**
- "When this vision is being realized, what will we observe in the world?"
- "What evidence would prove this is working?"
- "What would we actually see happening?"

**Sharpening into SMART objectives:**
- "What specific numbers would indicate success?"
- "By when would you need to hit these targets?"
- "How will you measure [the thing you mentioned]?"
- "What counts as 'active' or 'engaged' in your context?"
- "Is that achievable given your resources and timeline?"

### Saga's Facilitation Techniques

**Like BMad v6, Saga:**
- **Asks one question at a time** (never overwhelming)
- **Listens to your full answer** before responding
- **Reflects back what you said** to confirm understanding
- **Asks clarifying follow-ups** naturally
- **Documents as you talk** (you don't type, she captures it)
- **Challenges gently** when something needs sharpening
- **Makes you feel heard** throughout the conversation

**The result:** You end the conversation with clear, documented goals that feel like yours (because they are) - Saga just helped you articulate them.

## Generic Example Walkthrough

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Rushing Through Saga's Questions

**Problem:** Giving short, surface-level answers to move faster
**Why it fails:** Saga can't help you think deeply, results are shallow
**Fix:** Take time with each question. Saga's pace is intentional.

### Mistake 2: Not Challenging Vague Language

**Problem:** Accepting when Saga reflects back fuzzy thinking
**Why it fails:** Ends with goals you can't actually use
**Fix:** When something doesn't feel right, say so. Saga will help sharpen it.

### Mistake 3: Bringing Pre-Written Goals

**Problem:** "Here are my goals, just document them"
**Why it fails:** Misses the value of Saga's guided thinking process
**Fix:** Come prepared with ideas, but let Saga guide you to refine them

### Mistake 4: Saying Yes to Too Many Objectives

**Problem:** Saga suggests narrowing to 5, you insist on keeping 15
**Why it fails:** Dilutes focus, creates confusion for later workshops
**Fix:** Trust Saga's strategic advice - she knows what feeds into Workshop 2-5

### Mistake 5: Setting Unrealistic Targets to Impress

**Problem:** Inflating numbers because they sound better
**Why it fails:** Later workshops build on these - unrealistic goals cascade
**Fix:** Be honest with Saga about resources and constraints

### Mistake 6: Skipping the Bridging Question

**Problem:** Jumping straight from vision to random metrics
**Why it fails:** Goals feel disconnected from the bigger purpose
**Fix:** Let Saga guide you through "what will we observe?" - it's the key step

## How This Feeds Into Next Workshops

**Workshop 1 creates the foundation:**

```
Business Goals (Vision + Objectives)
    ↓
Workshop 2: Which user groups can help achieve these?
    ↓
Workshop 3: What drives those groups' behavior?
    ↓
Workshop 4: Which groups and drivers matter most?
    ↓
Workshop 5: Which features address top priorities?
```

Everything traces back to the goals you define here.

## Tips for a Successful Dialog with Saga

**DO:**
- ✅ Think out loud - Saga learns from your reasoning, not just your answers
- ✅ Challenge what doesn't feel right - Saga wants you to push back
- ✅ Ask Saga to explain why she's asking something - it helps you think
- ✅ Reference your Product Brief - Saga will connect the dots
- ✅ Take time to think before answering - this isn't a speed test
- ✅ Trust Saga when she suggests sharpening fuzzy language

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Rush through to "get it done" - thoughtful answers = better outcomes
- ❌ Give one-word answers - Saga needs context to help you think
- ❌ Treat it like a form - it's a conversation, not data entry
- ❌ Accept vague objectives just to move on - Saga will help you sharpen
- ❌ Inflate numbers to sound impressive - be realistic with Saga
- ❌ Skip the vision phase - Saga needs the "why" before the "what"
