# Lesson 4: Workshop 2 - Target Groups

**Saga Helps You Identify Who Ensures Your Success**

---

## The Core Question Saga Explores With You

Through guided conversation, Saga helps you answer: **WHO out there in the world will make sure, with their use of the product, that you achieve your goals?**

This question contains the entire chain of value creation. Let's break it down:

### Breaking Down the Question

**"WHO"**
- Which representative from which ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)?
- Specific behavioral and contextual profiles
- Not demographics, but real people with real contexts

**"Out there in the world"**
- These are real people whose lives your product needs to touch
- Not abstract user segments, but actual humans in specific situations
- Your product must reach and impact their reality

**"Will make sure"**
- A product needs to be used, and used in the intended way
- Usage alone isn't enough - it must be the right usage
- Their behavior drives the outcome

**"With their use of the product"**
- The product must give more value than the pain of using it
- If usage pain > value gained, they won't care
- They need motivation to engage and continue

**"That you achieve your goals"**
- The use of the product must tie to measurable business goals
- Without this connection, success isn't possible
- This completes the chain: WHO → uses product → right way → creates value → achieves goals

**This distinction is critical** and reflects throughout the entire Trigger Mapping methodology.

## Overview

Workshop 2 is where Saga guides you to identify the specific user groups whose behavior will drive your business success. Through thoughtful questions, Saga helps you create detailed personas and prioritize them by strategic value.

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes
**Format:** Guided dialog with Saga (exploring one persona at a time)
**Output:** 3-5 prioritized personas with deep context (documented by Saga)

---

## How the Guided Dialog Works

### Phase 1: Saga Helps You Identify User Groups

**Saga starts with your business goals from Workshop 1:**

Saga asks who could help you achieve those specific objectives. She guides you away from demographics ("parents aged 30-45") toward behavioral and contextual profiles ("busy working parents juggling multiple schedules while afraid of dropping the ball").

**Natural conversation flow:**
> **Saga:** "Looking at your goal of achieving 5,000 active teams, who are the people whose behavior would drive that success?"
> **You:** "Well, team leaders who manage remote teams..."
> **Saga:** "Good - tell me more about these team leaders. What's their world like?"
> **You:** [You describe their context and challenges]
> **Saga:** "So they're managing distributed teams with limited visibility. What else defines this group?"

**Saga documents each group** as you identify them together. She'll guide you to 3-5 distinct groups - not more.

### Phase 2: Saga Draws Out Deep Persona Profiles

**For each group, Saga asks about WHO they really are:**

Through natural conversation, Saga helps you build rich profiles - not surface demographics, but real context, behavioral patterns, and their current reality before your product exists.

**Dialog example:**
> **Saga:** "Let's dig into Remote Team Leads. What's their daily context?"
> **You:** "They're managing 5-10 people across different time zones..."
> **Saga:** "That sounds isolating. How do they currently handle team health?"
> **You:** "Mostly check-ins and hoping people speak up..."
> **Saga:** "And when people don't speak up?"
> **You:** "That's their fear - problems brewing that they can't see."

**Saga captures the persona profile** - context, behavioral patterns, current reality. No template forms.

**Note:** Saga focuses on WHO they are in this phase. Usage goals and fears come later when she asks: "When this persona encounters your problem space and discovers your product, what do they want? What do they fear?"

### Phase 3: Saga Guides Strategic Prioritization

**Saga helps you rank groups by strategic value:**

Through questioning, Saga helps you think through impact on business goals, feasibility to reach, and urgency of pain. She challenges when priorities seem unclear or inconsistent with your objectives.

**Dialog example:**
> **Saga:** "We have three groups. Which has the most potential to drive your 5,000 team goal?"
> **You:** "Probably team leads - each one brings their whole team..."
> **Saga:** "Good insight. And can you reach them?"
> **You:** "Yes, through LinkedIn and management communities."
> **Saga:** "So Team Leads rank #1 for both impact and feasibility. What about Solo Workers vs Executives?"

**Saga documents the ranking** with strategic reasoning for each placement.

## Saga's Conversational Approach

### How Saga Explores User Groups

**Saga guides, doesn't interrogate.** She asks about one group at a time, listens deeply to your insights about their world, and reflects back what she's hearing to confirm understanding.

**Opening questions about groups:**
- "Looking at [your specific business goal], who are the people whose behavior would drive that success?"
- "Tell me about the different types of users who could help achieve this."
- "Who has the power to make [your objective] happen through their use of the product?"

**Deep dive into each persona (WHO they are):**
- "Let's explore [group name]. What's their daily context?"
- "What's going on in their world right now?"
- "How do they currently handle [the problem]?"
- "What behavioral patterns do you see in this group?"
- "What's their reality before they discover your solution?"

**Exploring usage goals (when they encounter your problem space):**
- "When [persona name] faces this problem and discovers your product, what do they want to achieve?"
- "What positive outcomes are they hoping for?"
- "And what are they afraid might happen?"
- "What keeps them up at night about this?"
- "What would 'success' look like to them?"

**Prioritization questions:**
- "Of these groups, which one has the most potential to drive [your top business goal]?"
- "Can you actually reach this group? How?"
- "How urgent is their pain compared to the others?"
- "So based on impact, feasibility, and urgency, how would you rank them?"
- "Why does [group] rank higher than [other group]?"

### Saga's Facilitation Techniques

**Like BMad v6, Saga:**
- **One persona at a time** - Doesn't overwhelm with all groups at once
- **Listens to your stories** - Your examples reveal more than abstract descriptions
- **Reflects behavioral insight** - "So they're constantly worried about missing warning signs..."
- **Challenges surface descriptions** - "But what's their actual day-to-day context?"
- **Documents rich profiles** - You describe, she captures the behavioral essence
- **Guides toward 3-5 groups** - Stops you from over-segmenting
- **Makes ranking strategic** - Links prioritization back to Workshop 1 goals

---

## Another Generic Example: Public Transport App

This example shows how the same "customers" (travelers) have completely different needs based on their context.

### Target Group 1: Daily Commuters

#### Persona Profile (WHO they are)

**Context:**
- Same route every workday (home ↔ work)
- Time-sensitive schedule (must arrive on time)
- Experienced with the system

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Checks app before leaving
- Knows alternative routes
- Values real-time updates
- Wants predictability

#### Usage Goals (When they face their commute)

*When Daily Commuters open our app, they want to...*

**Positive Drivers (what they want to achieve):**
- Get to work/home efficiently
- Minimize waiting time
- Avoid delays and disruptions

**Negative Drivers (what they want to avoid):**
- Being late to work (professional consequences)
- Missing important meetings
- Unpredictable commute times

**Priority:** #1 (Highest volume, daily usage, urgent needs)

---

### Target Group 2: Tourists

#### Persona Profile (WHO they are)

**Context:**
- Unfamiliar with the city and transit system
- Exploring multiple destinations
- No time pressure but limited trip duration

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Plans routes in advance
- Needs step-by-step guidance
- Values visual/map-based navigation
- Seeks reassurance at each step

#### Usage Goals (When they face navigation)

*When Tourists open our app, they want to...*

**Positive Drivers (what they want to achieve):**
- Navigate unfamiliar system confidently
- Find best routes to attractions
- Understand ticketing and payment
- Maximize sightseeing time

**Negative Drivers (what they want to avoid):**
- Wasting vacation time being lost

- Missing key attractions
- Overpaying for tickets

**Priority:** #2 (Growing market, different needs than commuters)

---

### Target Group 3: Seniors

#### Persona Profile (WHO they are)

**Context:**
- May have mobility limitations
- Less familiar with digital tools
- Often traveling during off-peak hours
- May need accessibility features

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Prefers simple, clear interfaces
- Values accessibility information
- Needs larger text and clear instructions
- May prefer human assistance options

#### Usage Goals (When they face travel planning)

*When Seniors open our app, they want to...*

**Positive Drivers (what they want to achieve):**
- Travel safely and comfortably
- Avoid physical strain (stairs, long walks)
- Feel confident using the system
- Maintain independence

**Negative Drivers (what they want to avoid):**
- Falling or getting injured
- Being stranded or unable to get help
- Losing independence
- Embarrassment from not understanding technology

**Priority:** #3 (Important for accessibility, regulatory requirements)

---

### Why This Example Works

**Same product (public transport app), completely different needs:**

**Commuters need:**
- Real-time delay alerts
- Quick route alternatives
- Predictability and reliability
- Speed and efficiency

**Tourists need:**
- Step-by-step navigation
- Visual/map-based guidance
- Ticketing help
- Confidence and reassurance

**Seniors need:**
- Accessibility information
- Simple, clear interfaces
- Larger text and buttons
- Safety and comfort features

**The insight:** If you designed only for commuters (speed and efficiency), you'd fail tourists and seniors. If you designed only for tourists (detailed guidance), you'd frustrate commuters who want speed. Understanding these distinct groups allows you to prioritize features strategically.

---

## Why Behavioral Profiles Matter

### Not This (Demographics)

"Parents aged 30-45 with household income $75K+"

**Problem:** Doesn't tell you what drives behavior, what they need, or how to design for them.

### This (Behavioral + Contextual)

"Busy working parents juggling multiple kids' schedules, family dog care, and full-time jobs - constantly afraid of dropping the ball on family responsibilities"

**Why it works:** You understand their world, their challenges, their fears. You can design for their actual needs.

---

## Prioritization Criteria

### Impact on Business Goals

**Ask:**
- Which group's behavior most directly drives our objectives?
- Which group has the power to make our goals happen?
- Which group's success equals our success?

**Example:** Remote Team Leads rank #1 because each one brings 5-10 users (their team), has budget authority, and urgent pain.

### Feasibility to Reach

**Ask:**
- Can we actually reach this group?
- Do we have channels to communicate with them?
- Can we serve them with our resources?
- Is the market size sufficient?

**Example:** Executives rank lower because they're harder to reach despite high value.

### Urgency of Pain

**Ask:**
- How urgent is their problem?
- Are they actively seeking solutions?
- What's the cost of not solving this?

**Example:** Team Leads have urgent pain (team burnout risk) vs Solo Workers have chronic pain (isolation).

## What You Get from Workshop 2

✅ **3-5 prioritized personas** - Rich behavioral profiles, not demographic categories
✅ **Deep contextual understanding** - Saga helped you articulate each group's world
✅ **Strategic ranking** - Clear priorities based on impact, feasibility, and urgency
✅ **Documented profiles** - Saga captured everything as you talked
✅ **Foundation for psychology mapping** - These personas feed Workshop 3
✅ **Focused clarity** - You know exactly who you're designing for and why
✅ **Behavioral insight** - You understand their context, not just their demographics

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Giving Saga Demographics Instead of Context

**Problem:** "Males 25-40 with college degrees"
**Why it fails:** Saga can't build behavioral profiles from demographics alone
**Fix:** When Saga asks about the group, describe their world, their context, their daily reality

### Mistake 2: Insisting on Too Many Groups

**Problem:** "We have 10 different user types we need to include"
**Why it fails:** Saga will guide you to 3-5 for strategic focus
**Fix:** Trust Saga's guidance - you can always expand later after validating the core groups

### Mistake 3: Refusing to Prioritize

**Problem:** "All these groups are equally important to us"
**Why it fails:** Saga needs clear priorities for Workshops 3-5 to work effectively
**Fix:** Let Saga help you make the hard choices based on strategic value

### Mistake 4: Accepting Surface-Level Descriptions

**Problem:** "They want to be productive" (accepting generic statements)
**Why it fails:** Saga can't build deep personas from shallow descriptions
**Fix:** When Saga digs deeper with follow-ups, take time to think and elaborate

### Mistake 5: Skipping Feasibility Discussion

**Problem:** Not being honest about which groups you can actually reach
**Why it fails:** Later roadmap won't be executable
**Fix:** Be realistic with Saga about your marketing channels and resources

### Mistake 6: Mixing Up "Who They Are" and "What They Want"

**Problem:** Describing goals before describing the person
**Why it fails:** Saga builds personas first, usage goals come in Workshop 3
**Fix:** When Saga asks "who are they?" focus on context and behavior, not desires

---

## How This Feeds Into Next Workshops

**Workshop 2 sets up the psychology mapping:**

```
Business Goals
    ↓
Target Groups (prioritized personas)
    ↓
Workshop 3: What drives each group's behavior?
    ↓
Workshop 4: Which drivers are most powerful?
    ↓
Workshop 5: Which features address top drivers?
```

The personas you create here become the foundation for understanding psychological drivers.

## Tips for a Successful Dialog with Saga

**DO:**
- ✅ Tell stories about real people when describing groups - Saga learns from examples
- ✅ Go deep when Saga asks follow-ups - she's looking for behavioral insight
- ✅ Be honest about which groups you can actually reach and serve
- ✅ Let Saga challenge surface-level descriptions - she's helping you think deeper
- ✅ Trust Saga when she suggests narrowing to 3-5 groups - focus is strategic
- ✅ Describe WHO they are (context, behavior) before WHAT they want (goals, fears)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Give demographics when Saga asks for behavioral profiles
- ❌ Insist on including every possible user type - dilutes strategic focus
- ❌ Say "all groups are equal" - Saga needs clear priorities for next workshops
- ❌ Accept your first description - let Saga dig for richer context
- ❌ Skip the feasibility conversation - be realistic about reach and resources
- ❌ Mix up persona descriptions with usage goals - Saga handles these in sequence

---

## What's Next

Workshop 3 maps the psychological drivers for each persona - both what they want to achieve (positive drivers) and what they want to avoid (negative drivers). This is where you understand the psychology that drives behavior.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Guided exploration** - Saga asks about one persona at a time, building depth through conversation
✅ **Two-part structure** - First WHO they are (persona context), then what they want (usage goals)
✅ **Behavioral not demographic** - Saga guides you to context and patterns, not age and income
✅ **3-5 groups by design** - Saga keeps you focused on strategic value
✅ **Strategic prioritization** - Saga helps you rank by impact + feasibility + urgency
✅ **Stories reveal insight** - Your examples help Saga understand and document behavioral profiles
✅ **Foundation for psychology** - These personas feed directly into Workshop 3
✅ **Like BMad v6** - Natural dialog that draws out deeper insight than you'd write alone
