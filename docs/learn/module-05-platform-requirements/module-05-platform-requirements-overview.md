# Module 05: Platform Requirements

**Time: 30 min | Agent: Saga | Phase: Strategy**

## What You'll Learn

How to define the technical boundaries that inform your design decisions before you start designing.

---

## Why This Matters

Imagine designing a beautiful real-time collaboration feature... then learning the backend can't support WebSockets.

Or specifying an offline-first mobile experience... when the client only has budget for a web app.

**Knowing the tech stack is a necessity for UX work — not optional.**

You can't design well in ignorance. The platform shapes the experience.

---

## Not Architecture — Boundaries

You're not designing the database. You're not specifying API endpoints. That's development work.

You're understanding what's possible so your designs are grounded in reality.

---

## What You'll Discover

### 1. Platforms

Where will this product live?

- Web only?
- Mobile (iOS, Android, both)?
- Desktop application?
- All of the above?

Each platform has different capabilities and constraints.

### 2. Integrations

What systems must we connect to?

- Authentication (OAuth, SSO, custom)?
- Payment processing?
- Third-party APIs?
- Legacy systems?
- External databases?

### 3. Constraints

What's technically impossible or expensive?

- Hosting limitations?
- Budget constraints?
- Team expertise?
- Timeline restrictions?
- Regulatory requirements?

### 4. Complexity & Challenges

Investigate integrations from a strategic standpoint:

- How complex is this integration really?
- What's the challenge level?
- Is this well-understood or experimental?
- Are there unknowns that need research?

### 5. Knowledge Gaps

What do we **not** know yet?

- Unproven technology?
- Missing documentation?
- No team expertise?
- Needs a spike or proof-of-concept?

**Surface these gaps explicitly.** They become tasks for Idunn to investigate in parallel.

## The Saga Method

Saga helps you think through boundaries conversationally:

> "What platforms are we targeting?"
> "Are there any systems we need to integrate with?"
> "What technical constraints should I know about?"
> "Is there anything that feels risky or uncertain?"

She'll probe deeper where needed, ensuring nothing gets missed.

## Output

`A-Product-Brief/platform-requirements.md`

This document lives with your Project Brief because it's part of the strategic foundation — not a technical specification.

---

## Handoff to Idunn

Once platform requirements are documented, you can **send them to Idunn** immediately.

While you continue with UX design (Freya), Idunn can:

- Research knowledge gaps
- Spike complex integrations
- Set up the development environment
- Validate technical assumptions

**Parallel work.** Design and platform prep happen simultaneously.

---

## What's NOT in This Document

- Database schemas
- API specifications
- Code architecture
- Technical implementation details

Those come later, in BMM's architecture phase.

---

## Connection to Design

Every boundary you discover shapes your design:

| Boundary | Design Impact |
|----------|---------------|
| Web only | No native mobile gestures |
| No real-time | Polling instead of live updates |
| Tight budget | Simpler interactions |
| Legacy integration | Work within existing patterns |

---

## Practice

Think about your current project:

1. What platforms are you designing for?
2. What integrations are required?
3. What constraints exist?
4. What feels risky?

Document these before you start designing.

Now understand the user psychology that drives behavior.
