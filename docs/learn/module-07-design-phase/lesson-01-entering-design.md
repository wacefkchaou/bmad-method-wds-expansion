# Module 07: The Design Phase

## Lesson 1: Entering Design Mode

**The transition from strategy to creation**

---

## You've Built the Foundation

Take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished:

**Module 04: Project Brief** — Your North Star
- Vision and positioning
- Target users and stakeholders
- Success criteria and constraints

**Module 05: Platform Requirements** — Your Boundaries
- Platforms you're targeting
- Integrations required
- Constraints and knowledge gaps

**Module 06: Trigger Map** — User Psychology Mapped
- Personas with driving forces
- Business goals connected to features
- The "why" behind every decision

This is your strategic foundation. Every design decision you make from here forward references these documents.

---

## The Mindset Shift

Strategy is about **discovering and documenting**.
Design is about **visualizing and specifying**.

You're moving from:

| Strategy Mode | Design Mode |
|---------------|-------------|
| What should we build? | How should it work? |
| Why does this matter? | What does the user see? |
| Who is this for? | How do they accomplish their goal? |
| What's possible? | What exactly happens? |

Both matter. But they require different thinking.

## Before We Begin: Why Specifications Matter

Before diving into the design workflow, you need to understand a critical question:

**"Why can't we just skip to code?"**

**Short answer:** Because code is 10-20% of the value. Specifications are 80-90%.

**Your app exists in specifications.** The code is just one possible projection—like compiled output.

This isn't about "doing things the hard way." This is about **doing things the professional way** with AI-assisted development.

**→ [Read Lesson 2: Why Specifications Matter](lesson-02-why-specifications-matter.md)** for the complete philosophy behind WDS.

Key insights you'll learn:
- Code is a lossy projection from specifications
- Specifications align humans on shared goals
- Specs are meta-prompts that enable autonomous AI work
- Professional approach: Prompt → Spec → Code (not Prompt → Code → Debug hell)
- Why this represents "the spirit of BMad v6 through the lens of a designer"

**This foundation is critical.** Read Lesson 2 before continuing.

## Meet Freya

Freya is your design partner for this phase.

**What Freya does:**

- Thinks WITH you, not FOR you
- Asks "WHY?" before "WHAT?"
- Connects every decision to your Trigger Map
- Won't let you skip the hard thinking

**What Freya doesn't do:**

- Create pretty pictures without substance
- Make decisions for you
- Let you design in isolation from strategy
- Accept "I don't know" as a final answer

She's not a pixel pusher. She's a thinking partner who happens to work with visuals.

---

## The Freya Approach

Freya's first question is always strategic:

> "Looking at your Trigger Map, which persona's journey should we design first?"

Not: "What color should the button be?"

Every design decision connects back to your strategic foundation. If it doesn't connect, it gets questioned.

---

## The Design Workflow

Nine modules. Eight steps. One coherent journey.

```
Outline → Sketch → Storyboard → Specify → Components → Visual → System → Deliver
```

| Step | What You Do | What You Create |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Outline Scenarios** | Define user journeys | Scenario outlines |
| **Conceptual Sketching** | Visualize default states | Rough sketches |
| **Storyboarding** | Show transformations | Keyframe sequences |
| **Specifications** | Document every detail | Complete specs |
| **Components** | Define reusable patterns | Component definitions |
| **Visual Design** | Apply visual language | Polished designs |
| **Design System** | Organize for reuse | System documentation |
| **Delivery** | Package for implementation | Delivery package |

---

## Not Strictly Linear

You'll loop back. That's expected.

- Sketching reveals gaps in your scenario outline
- Storyboarding exposes missing states
- Specifications surface component needs
- Visual design raises consistency questions

**The loop is the process.** Don't fight it.

---

## Multiple Entry Points

Every step offers choices for how you start:

| Entry Point | How It Works |
|-------------|--------------|
| **I have a sketch** | You provide, AI refines |
| **I have inspiration** | You share, AI extracts patterns |
| **Dream it up** | AI creates options, you pick |
| **Let's discuss** | Conversation shapes the concept |

Same step. Same output. Different starting points.

You're not forced into one way of working. Use what feels natural for each situation.

---

## Creative Discipline

> "Creative discipline enables creativity, not constrains it."

This phrase captures the WDS approach to design.

**Without discipline:**
- Endless exploration with no conclusion
- Beautiful mockups that solve wrong problems
- Scattered work that can't be implemented
- Decisions without rationale

**With discipline:**
- Focused exploration with clear outcomes
- Beautiful mockups grounded in strategy
- Coherent work ready for implementation
- Every decision documented with WHY

Structure doesn't limit creativity. It channels it.

---

## What You'll Create

By the end of this phase:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Scenario outlines** | The journeys you're designing |
| **Conceptual sketches** | Visual explorations of each view |
| **Storyboards** | How elements transform |
| **Detailed specifications** | Every decision documented |
| **Component definitions** | Reusable patterns identified |
| **Visual designs** | Final look and feel |
| **Design system** | Your component library |
| **Delivery package** | Ready for Idunn to implement |

---

## Design System

Remember the choice from setup:

| Mode | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **1. None** | Ad-hoc styling, no extraction |
| **2. Building** | System grows from your work |
| **3. Library** | Use external + your branding |
| **4. Existing** | Import from previous projects |

This affects how Freya works with you throughout the phase.

**Mode 1-2:** You're creating the design language as you go
**Mode 3-4:** You're working within established patterns

Neither is better. Just different workflows.

---

## The Core Principle

Every pixel has a reason.
Every interaction traces back to user psychology.
Every component connects to a business goal.

**Nothing is decoration. Everything is decision.**

When you can explain WHY something exists, you've designed well.

When you can't explain it, something's missing.

---

## Ready to Design

You have:
- Strategic foundation (Project Brief, Trigger Map, Platform Requirements)
- A thinking partner (Freya)
- A clear workflow (8 steps)
- Flexible entry points (multiple ways to start each step)

Let's begin.
