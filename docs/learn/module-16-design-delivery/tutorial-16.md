# Tutorial 16: Create Your Delivery

**Hands-on guide to validating specifications and packaging for handoff**

---

## Overview

This tutorial walks you through validating your complete design work and creating a delivery package for implementation.

**Time:** 30-40 minutes
**Prerequisites:** All design work completed (Modules 08-15)
**Agent:** Freya
**What you'll create:** Validated specifications and delivery package

---

## Before You Start

**You'll need:**

- All your scenario outlines
- All your page specifications
- All your visual prototypes
- Your component documentation (if applicable)

**Freya will help you:**

- Audit specifications for gaps
- Create delivery documents
- Write acceptance criteria
- Prepare for handoff

---

## Step 1: Run the Validation Audit (10 min)

### Start the audit:

**You say:**
> "Please audit my specifications for S01-User-Registration. Check for completeness, traceability, and quality."

**Freya audits:**
> "Auditing S01-User-Registration..."

### Review findings:

**Freya reports:**
```
## Audit Results: S01-User-Registration

### Completeness
✓ All 3 pages specified
✓ All elements documented
⚠️ P02: Missing "rate limited" error state
✓ Content written (no lorem ipsum)
✓ Interactions described

### Traceability
✓ Connected to Trigger Map
✓ Persona: Felix
✓ Feature: F03-Quick-Signup
⚠️ P03 welcome screen: No business goal reference

### Quality
✓ Object IDs assigned
⚠️ Inconsistent terminology: "sign up" vs "signup"
✓ Accessibility considered

### Testability
⚠️ No acceptance criteria document yet
```

### Resolve issues:

**Freya:**
> "I found 4 issues. Let's resolve them:
>
> 1. **Rate limited error** — What message should show?"

**You respond:**
> "'Too many attempts. Please wait 5 minutes before trying again.'"

**Freya:**
> "2. **P03 business goal** — What goal does the welcome screen serve?"

**You respond:**
> "User activation — converting signup to first meaningful action."

**Freya:**
> "3. **Terminology** — Should we use 'signup' or 'sign up'?"

**You respond:**
> "'Sign up' as two words for the action verb, 'Signup' as one word for the noun/form name."

**Freya updates specifications with fixes.**

## Step 2: Create Delivery Overview (5 min)

### Generate delivery document:

**Freya:**
> "Creating delivery overview for DD01-User-Registration..."

```markdown
# DD01: User Registration

## Summary
First-time user signup flow enabling new users to create an account
and reach the welcome dashboard.

## Business Context
- Persona: Felix the Full-Stack
- Driving Force: "Want to try before committing"
- Goal: Reduce friction in user acquisition

## Scenarios Included
- S01-User-Registration

## Pages

| ID | Page | Spec | Visual | Status |
|----|------|------|--------|--------|
| P01 | Landing Page | ✓ | ✓ | Ready |
| P02 | Signup Form | ✓ | ✓ | Ready |
| P03 | Welcome Screen | ✓ | ✓ | Ready |

## Components Used
- Button (primary, secondary, ghost)
- Input (text, email, password)
- FormField (wrapper component)

## Technical Dependencies
- Supabase Auth (authentication)
- Supabase Database (user storage)
- Email service (optional verification)

## Design System
- Mode: Building
- Tokens: See D-Design-System/tokens/
- Components: See C-UX-Scenarios/Functional-Components/

## Implementation Notes
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Real-time form validation
- Password strength indicator
- Form data preserved on error
- Keyboard accessible throughout
```

---

## Step 3: Write Acceptance Criteria (10 min)

### Define testable requirements:

**Freya guides:**
> "Let's write acceptance criteria. Starting with the happy path..."

**Work through each category:**

### Happy Path

```markdown
## Happy Path

### Landing Page
- [ ] "Start Free" button is visible above fold
- [ ] Clicking "Start Free" navigates to signup form
- [ ] Login link navigates to login page

### Signup Form
- [ ] Form displays email and password fields
- [ ] Form displays "Create Free Account" button
- [ ] Button is disabled until form is valid
- [ ] Entering valid email removes email error
- [ ] Entering 8+ character password enables button
- [ ] Clicking submit shows loading state
- [ ] Successful submit navigates to welcome screen

### Welcome Screen
- [ ] Displays user's email address
- [ ] Shows clear next step guidance
- [ ] Provides navigation to main app
```

### Error Handling

```markdown
## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- [ ] Empty email: "Email is required"
- [ ] Invalid email format: "Please enter a valid email"
- [ ] Empty password: "Password is required"
- [ ] Password < 8 chars: "Password must be at least 8 characters"

### Server Errors
- [ ] Duplicate email: "This email is already registered. Log in instead →"
- [ ] Server error: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
- [ ] Network error: "Connection lost. Please check your internet."
- [ ] Rate limited: "Too many attempts. Please wait 5 minutes."

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Form data preserved after error
- [ ] User can edit and resubmit
- [ ] Duplicate email links to login flow
```

### Accessibility

```markdown
## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] All interactive elements focusable
- [ ] Focus order matches visual order
- [ ] Focus visible on all elements
- [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons
- [ ] Tab moves through form fields

### Screen Reader
- [ ] All inputs have visible labels
- [ ] Errors announced when they appear
- [ ] Button states announced (loading, disabled)
- [ ] Form submission result announced

### Visual
- [ ] Color contrast passes WCAG AA
- [ ] Text resizable to 200% without breaking
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44px
```

## Step 4: Organize Delivery Package (5 min)

### Create folder structure:

**Freya:**
> "Organizing delivery package..."

```
E-PRD/Design-Deliveries/
└── DD01-User-Registration/
    ├── delivery-overview.md
    ├── acceptance-criteria.md
    ├── scenarios/
    │   └── S01-User-Registration/
    │       └── [references to C-UX-Scenarios/S01/]
    └── components/
        └── [references to C-UX-Scenarios/Functional-Components/]
```

### Verify all links work:

**Freya checks:**
> "Verifying all specification references...
> - ✓ P01 landing page spec accessible
> - ✓ P02 signup form spec accessible
> - ✓ P03 welcome screen spec accessible
> - ✓ Visual prototypes accessible
> - ✓ Component docs accessible
>
> Delivery package is complete."

---

## Step 5: Final Review (5 min)

### The Developer Test:

**Freya asks:**
> "Can a developer who has never seen this project build it correctly from this delivery package?"

**Review checklist:**

- [ ] All pages specified completely
- [ ] All states documented
- [ ] All content finalized
- [ ] All error messages defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria testable
- [ ] Visual prototypes match specs
- [ ] Dependencies listed
- [ ] No ambiguous requirements

### Sign off:

**Freya:**
> "Delivery package DD01-User-Registration is validated and ready for handoff to Idunn.
>
> Summary:
> - 3 pages specified
> - 47 acceptance criteria
> - 0 outstanding issues
> - 4 components referenced
>
> Design phase complete for this scenario."

---

## Step 6: Handoff to Idunn (2 min)

### Prepare handoff message:

**Freya generates:**
```markdown
# Design Handoff: DD01-User-Registration

## For: Idunn (Implementation)
## From: Freya (Design)
## Date: [Today]

## Delivery Package
Location: E-PRD/Design-Deliveries/DD01-User-Registration/

## What's Included
- Complete specifications for 3 pages
- Visual prototypes (HTML)
- Component documentation
- Acceptance criteria (47 items)

## Dependencies Needed
- Supabase Auth configured
- User table in database
- Email service (optional)

## Priority
This is the primary user acquisition flow.
Recommend implementing before other scenarios.

## Questions?
Specifications should be complete. If anything is unclear,
the specification needs updating rather than verbal clarification.

---
Design phase complete. Ready for implementation.
```

---

## What You've Created

### Delivery Package:

- **Delivery overview** — Summary for developers
- **Acceptance criteria** — Testable requirements
- **Organized references** — Links to all specs and visuals

### Validated:

- All specifications complete
- All gaps resolved
- All content finalized
- All criteria testable

---

## Tips for Success

**DO:**

- Run the audit before declaring complete
- Resolve all gaps before delivery
- Write specific acceptance criteria
- Reference, don't duplicate

**DON'T:**

- Skip validation ("it's probably fine")
- Leave vague requirements
- Forget accessibility criteria
- Package without final review

---
