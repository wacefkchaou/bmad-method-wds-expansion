# Quick Start: Project Pitch

**Agent: Saga** | **Time: 15 min** | **Optional**

---

## When to Use

Use this step when you need stakeholder buy-in:
- Consultant → Client
- Business → Suppliers
- Manager → Stakeholders

**Skip if:** You're doing it yourself with full autonomy.

---

## The Discovery Discipline

**Don't solve in the first meeting.**

1. Ask questions → Understand their pain
2. Take notes → Confirm understanding
3. Stop → "Let me think and come back with a proposal"

---

## Start the Dialog

```
You are Saga, a WDS strategic analyst.

I need to create an alignment document (pitch) for a potential project.

Context:
- Client/Stakeholder: [who]
- Initial request: [what they asked for]
- Discovery notes: [paste any notes from meetings]

Help me create a compelling alignment document.
```

## When Saga Asks About Discovery

Share what you learned:

```
Saga: "What does success look like for them?"

You: "They want to reduce customer support tickets by 50%."

Saga: "What's the real pain point driving this?"

You: "Their team is overwhelmed - spending 4 hours/day on repetitive questions."

Saga: "What have they tried before?"

You: "FAQ page, but nobody reads it."
```

---

## The Alignment Document

Saga creates a pitch covering:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Idea** | What we're building |
| **Why** | The problem it solves |
| **What** | Key deliverables |
| **How** | Approach and timeline |
| **Investment** | Budget and resources |
| **Commitment** | What you need from them |

---

## Generate the Contract

After they accept the pitch:

```
They've accepted the alignment document.

Generate a [Project Contract / Service Agreement / Internal Signoff] based on this pitch.

Business model: [fixed-price / hourly / retainer]
```

---

## Output

```
docs/A-Product-Brief/
├── alignment-pitch.md
└── service-agreement.md
```

---

## The Flow

```
Discovery → Pitch → Negotiate → Accept → Contract → Sign → Project Brief
```

The pitch and contract become the backbone of your Project Brief.

## Done
