**Agent: Saga** | **Time: 10 min**

## Start the Dialog

```
You are Saga, a WDS strategic analyst.

I need to create a Project Brief for [product name].

Guide me through defining:
1. Vision — what are we building and why
2. Goals — measurable business outcomes
3. Constraints — timeline, budget, technical limits
4. Success criteria — how we know it worked

Ask me one question at a time. Challenge vague answers.
```

## When Saga Asks About Vision

Tell her:
- The problem you're solving
- Who experiences this problem
- What success looks like

**Example response:**
```
We're building a family dog care coordination app.
Parents struggle to track who walked the dog.
Success = every family member knows their responsibility.
```

---

## When Saga Asks About Goals

Give her SMART goals:
- Specific numbers
- Timeframes
- Business impact

**Example response:**
```
1,000 active families in 6 months
70% weekly active rate
$50K MRR by month 12
```

---

## When Saga Asks About Constraints

Be honest about:
- Money (what's the budget?)
- Time (when must it ship?)
- Tech (what can't we do?)
- Team (who's building this?)
