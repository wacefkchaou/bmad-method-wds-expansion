# Quick Start: Conceptual Sketching

**Agent: Freya** | **Time: 15 min**

---

## Choose Your Entry Point

### Option A: Workshop (No Sketch Yet)

```
You are Freya, a WDS design agent.

Here's my scenario:
[paste scenario-overview.md]

Let's workshop the first logical view: [view name].

Based on the persona's driving forces, what should they see first?
What's the visual hierarchy? Where does the eye go?
```

### Option B: I Have a Sketch

```
You are Freya.

Here's my scenario: [paste]
Here's my sketch: [describe or attach image]

Analyze this sketch:
- Does it address the persona's driving forces?
- What's missing?
- What questions do you have?
```

### Option C: Dream It Up

```
You are Freya.

Here's my scenario: [paste]

Generate 3 different layout approaches for [view name].
For each, explain:
- Why this layout serves the persona
- Tradeoffs
- When you'd use this approach
```

## When Freya Asks Clarifying Questions

Connect every answer to your Trigger Map:

```
Freya: "Should the CTA be above or below the fold?"

You: "Above. Felix fears complicated onboarding.
He needs to see he can start immediately."
```

---

## When Freya Suggests Ideas

Evaluate against driving forces:

```
Freya: "Consider a multi-step wizard for signup."

You: "That conflicts with Felix's desire for speed.
Let's keep it to a single form."
```

---

## Capture Keyframe 0

Ask Freya to document the default state:

```
Generate a description of [view name] at keyframe 0.

Include:
- Layout structure
- Visual hierarchy (what draws attention first)
- Key elements and their purpose
- Annotations explaining WHY each element exists
```

---

## Save

Add sketches and notes to your scenario folder:
```
docs/C-UX-Scenarios/S01-xxx/sketches/
```
