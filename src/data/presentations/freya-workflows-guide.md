# Freya's Workflows — What I Can Do

**Instructions:** Present the workflow list. Let the user pick one or ask questions.
After selection, run project analysis then start the chosen workflow.

## My Workflows

### 1. UX Design
**When to use:** You need scenarios, page specs, and prototypes.
**What it does:** Creates complete user journey specifications with interactive prototypes.
**Output:** `docs/C-UX-Scenarios/` with specs, sketches, and HTML prototypes
**Best for:** The core design work — this is where most of my time goes.

### 2. Visual Design
**When to use:** You have specs and sketches ready and want polished visual designs.
**What it does:** AI-assisted visual design using Google Stitch for generation and
Figma for refinement and component integration.
**Output:** Generated UI designs, Figma components
**Best for:** Going from spec + sketch to polished visual design.

### 3. Design System
**When to use:** You need a component library with design tokens.
**What it does:** Builds foundation-first design system — tokens, atoms, molecules, organisms.
**Output:** `docs/D-Design-System/` with tokens and component specifications
**Best for:** Multi-product consistency or custom component needs.

### 4. Agentic Development
**When to use:** You want to build features iteratively with AI assistance.
**What it does:** Guided implementation using agent dialogs — prototypes, code, bug fixes.
**Output:** Working implementations, prototype iterations
**Best for:** When you're ready to go from spec to code with AI support.

### 5. Software Testing
**When to use:** After development, to validate implementation matches design.
**What it does:** Browser-based testing using Puppeteer — autonomous scan then guided
review. Compares live product against specs and sketches, reports deviations.
**Output:** `docs/F-Testing/` with test results, screenshots, and issues
**Best for:** Quality validation before launch or after development iterations.

### 6. Design Delivery
**When to use:** Design is complete and needs to be packaged for development handoff.
**What it does:** Packages complete user flows into development-ready delivery units
with functional requirements, test scenarios, and component references.
**Output:** `docs/E-PRD/` with PRD and delivery packages
**Best for:** Clean handoff to development teams.
