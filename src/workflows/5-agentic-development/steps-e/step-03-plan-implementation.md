# Step 3: Plan Implementation

## STEP GOAL:

Create an ordered, incremental implementation plan with verification points.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an Implementation Partner guiding structured development activities
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring software development methodology expertise, user brings domain knowledge and codebase familiarity
- ✅ Maintain clear and structured tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on ordering changes, planning incremental commits, defining verification points, and estimating effort
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to begin writing code — that is the next step
- 💬 Approach: Collaboratively sequence the implementation with user, ensuring each step leaves the system working
- 📋 Each commit must be a complete, working unit with clear verification criteria

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Produce a sequenced implementation plan with verification points between steps
- 💾 Write implementation plan to the dialog file
- 📖 Reference the scope from Step 1 and risk assessment from Step 2
- 🚫 Do not write any code during this step

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Scope and boundary map from Step 1; impact analysis and risks from Step 2
- Focus: Implementation planning — order, commits, verification, feature flags
- Limits: No code writing
- Dependencies: Steps 1 and 2 must be complete

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Order Changes by Dependency

- Start with foundational changes (data models, utilities, shared logic)
- Then build upward: API endpoints, components, pages, integrations
- Each step should build on the previous one
- No step should depend on a later step

### 2. Determine If Feature Flags Are Needed

Use feature flags when:
- The change is large enough that partial deployment is risky
- The feature needs to be toggled per environment or per user
- Rollback needs to be instant (without redeploying)

If not needed, keep it simple — branches and PRs are sufficient.

### 3. Plan Incremental Commits

Each commit should:
- Be a complete, working unit (system stays functional after each commit)
- Be small enough to review and understand
- Have a clear purpose described in its message

Example plan structure:
```
Commit 1: Add new data model (no UI, no routes)
Commit 2: Add API endpoint for new feature (behind feature flag)
Commit 3: Add new component (rendered only in new context)
Commit 4: Integrate component into existing page
Commit 5: Enable feature, update tests
```

### 4. Define Verification Points

Between steps, define what to check:
- After commit 1: "Run migrations, verify existing queries still work"
- After commit 3: "Render component in isolation, verify it matches spec"
- After commit 4: "Full regression on existing page, verify new feature appears"

### 5. Estimate Effort

- Note which steps are straightforward vs which carry risk
- Identify steps that may need designer/stakeholder input
- Flag any steps that might require splitting into sub-steps

### 6. Verify Checklist

- [ ] Changes ordered by dependency
- [ ] Feature flag decision made and documented
- [ ] Incremental commits planned (each leaves system working)
- [ ] Verification points defined between steps
- [ ] Effort estimated, risks flagged
- [ ] Implementation plan written to dialog file

### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Step 4: Implement"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the implementation plan is complete with ordered steps, verification points, and feature flag decisions will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- Changes ordered by dependency
- Feature flag decision made and documented
- Incremental commits planned (each leaves system working)
- Verification points defined between steps
- Effort estimated, risks flagged
- Implementation plan written to dialog file

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
- Beginning implementation without a complete plan
- Planning commits that leave the system in a broken state
- Not defining verification points
- Skipping feature flag assessment

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
