# Step 6.6: Continue with Next Flow

## Your Task

While BMad builds the current flow, start designing the next complete testable flow.

---

## Parallel Work Strategy

**See:** [substeps/delivery-templates.md](substeps/delivery-templates.md) for parallel work schedule and iteration cadence

**The key to fast delivery:** You're never waiting! Always working!

---

## Return to Phase 4-5

### Identify Next Flow

**Prioritization criteria:**

1. **User value:** What solves the biggest user problem?
2. **Business value:** What delivers the most ROI?
3. **Dependencies:** What needs to be built next?
4. **Risk:** What's the riskiest to validate early?

### Phase 4: UX Design

Design scenarios for the next flow:
1. Identify trigger moment
2. Design scenarios (entry, actions, responses, exit)
3. Create specifications in `C-UX-Scenarios/XX-scenario-name/`
4. Document user flows (happy path, errors, edge cases)

### Phase 5: Design System

Define components for this flow:
1. Identify needed components (reuse vs new)
2. Define new components in `D-Design-System/03-Atomic-Components/`
3. Update design tokens if needed

## When to Return to Phase 6

**Return when:**

- ✅ All scenarios for next flow are specified
- ✅ All components for next flow are defined
- ✅ Flow is testable end-to-end
- ✅ Flow delivers business and user value
- ✅ No blockers or dependencies

**Then repeat Phase 6 cycle (6.1 → 6.6)**

---

## Managing Multiple Flows

**Track your work using tracker template in substeps.**

**Communication:** Keep BMad informed with weekly updates (template in substeps).

---

## Balancing Design and Validation

As flows complete, you'll be doing both:

- **Early week:** Test completed flows (Phase 7)
- **Late week:** Design new scenarios

**This is the steady state!**

---

## When to Pause

**Pause designing if:**

- BMad is blocked and needs design clarification
- Too many flows in progress (overwhelming the team)
- Validation backlog building up

**Priority:** Unblock BMad and clear validation backlog first!

---

## Success Metrics

✅ Next flow identified and prioritized
✅ Returned to Phase 4-5 (UX Design & Design System)
✅ Parallel work happening (design + development)
✅ Communication with BMad maintained
✅ Tracker updated
✅ Continuous improvement mindset

---

## Failure Modes

❌ Waiting for BMad instead of designing next flow
❌ Designing too many flows ahead (overwhelming BMad)
❌ Not prioritizing validation when flows complete
❌ Losing track of multiple flows
❌ Not learning from each cycle
❌ Disappearing after handoff

---

## Completion

**Phase 6 is complete when:**

- ✅ Design Delivery created and handed off
- ✅ BMad is building the flow
- ✅ You've started designing the next flow

**Return to Phase 6 when next flow is ready for handoff!**

---

## Next Steps

**Three paths:**

```
[D] Return to Phase 4-5 to design next flow (Most Common)
[V] Go to Phase 7 if a flow is ready for validation
[C] All flows designed and handed off! Wait for validations.
```

**Keep the momentum going! Design → Handoff → Build → Test → Ship!** 🚀
