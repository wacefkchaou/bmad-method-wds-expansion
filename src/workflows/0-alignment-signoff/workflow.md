# Alignment & Signoff Workflow

**Purpose**: Create alignment around your idea before starting the project

**When to Use**:
- ✅ **Use Alignment & Signoff** if you need alignment with others:
  - Consultant proposing a solution to a client
  - Business hiring consultants/suppliers to build software
  - Manager/employee seeking approval for an internal project
  - Any scenario where stakeholders need to agree before starting

- ⏭️ **Skip Alignment & Signoff** if you're doing it yourself:
  - You have full autonomy and don't need approval
  - Go straight to the Project Brief workflow

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all sections in order within a step
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at decision points and wait for user
4. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load and execute the next step

---

## INITIALIZATION

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{project-root}/_bmad/wds/config.yaml` and resolve:
- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`, `communication_language`

### 2. Agent Dialog Gate

1. Check `{output_folder}/_progress/agent-dialogs/` for pending alignment dialogs
2. If pending, present with status
3. If none, suggest creating one

### 3. Start

Load and execute `./steps-c/step-01a-understand-situation.md`

## STEPS

### Phase 1: Start & Understand (step-01*)

| Step | Name | Purpose |

| 01c | Offer Extract | Offer to extract from existing communications |
| 01d | Extract Info | Pull information from shared documents |
| 01e | Detect Starting Point | Route to appropriate explore section |

### Phase 2: Explore Sections (step-02*)

Explore 10 alignment document sections (flexible order):

| Step | Section | Topic |
|------|---------|-------|
| 02a | 1 | The Realization |
| 02b | - | The Solution |
| 02c | 2 | Why It Matters |

| Step | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 03a | Reflect Back | Synthesize understanding, confirm |
| 03b | Synthesize Document | Create alignment document |
| 03c | Create VTC | Value Trigger Chain (refs `1-project-brief/vtc-workshop/`) |
| 03d | Present for Approval | Share with stakeholders |

### Phase 4: Generate Signoff (step-04*)

| Step | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 04a | Offer Signoff | Present signoff options |
| 04b | Determine Business Model | Route to appropriate signoff type |

### Phase 5: Build Contract (step-05*)

| 05i | 9 | Work Initiation |
| 05j | 10 | Terms and Conditions |
| 05k | 11 | Approval |
| 05l | - | Finalize Contract |

### Phase 6: Build Internal Signoff (step-06*)
