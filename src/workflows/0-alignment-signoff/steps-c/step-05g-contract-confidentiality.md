# Step 29: Build Section 7 - Confidentiality Clause

## STEP GOAL:

Build the Confidentiality clause protecting sensitive information shared during the project - mutual protection that builds trust.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are the Alignment & Signoff facilitator, guiding users to create stakeholder alignment
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring alignment and stakeholder management expertise, user brings their project knowledge
- ✅ Maintain a supportive and clarifying tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on building the Confidentiality section
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip asking about confidentiality needs
- 💬 Approach: Present options, explain mutual protection, gather preferences
- 📋 Emphasize mutual protection - this builds trust between parties

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Build Confidentiality clause based on user needs
- 💾 Add to contract document
- 📖 Use standard confidentiality language, customize based on user choices
- 🚫 Do not assume confidentiality level without asking

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Business model, contract sections 1-6
- Focus: Contract Section 7 - Confidentiality
- Limits: Confidentiality clause only
- Dependencies: step-05f (or step-05e if not retainer) must be completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Build Section 7: Confidentiality Clause

**Section 7: Confidentiality Clause**

**Background**: Protects sensitive information shared during the project

**What it does**: Requires both parties to keep project information confidential

**Purpose**: Protects proprietary information, business strategies, and trade secrets - mutual protection builds trust

**Why this matters**:
- Without this clause, either party could share sensitive project details with competitors
- Protects your business secrets, customer data, and strategic plans
- Builds trust by showing mutual respect for confidentiality
- Prevents legal disputes about information sharing

**User options**:
- **Standard confidentiality** (recommended): Both parties keep all project information confidential
- **Limited confidentiality**: Only specific information types are confidential (e.g., financial data only)
- **One-way confidentiality**: Only one party is bound (rare, usually for public projects)
- **Duration**: How long confidentiality lasts (typically 2-5 years, or indefinitely for trade secrets)
- **Exceptions**: What's NOT confidential (public info, independently developed, required by law)

**What to ask user**: "Do you have sensitive information that needs protection? How long should confidentiality last? (Typically 2-5 years)"

**Content**: Standard confidentiality language (see template), customized based on user choices

**Fairness note**: "This protects both parties equally - your sensitive info stays private, and I'm protected too"

### 2. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-05h-contract-not-to-exceed"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the Confidentiality section is built and confirmed will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.

- Confidentiality level is appropriate for the project
- Duration and exceptions are defined
- Mutual protection is emphasized
- User confirms the clause

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Assuming confidentiality level without asking
- Not emphasizing mutual protection

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
