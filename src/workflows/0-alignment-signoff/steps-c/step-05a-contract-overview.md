- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- 📋 Sets clear expectations and context for the contract

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

### 2. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-05b-contract-business-model"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}

- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the Project Overview section is built and confirmed will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.
