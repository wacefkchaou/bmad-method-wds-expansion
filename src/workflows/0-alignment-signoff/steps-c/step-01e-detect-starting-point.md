# Step 5: Detect Starting Point

## STEP GOAL:

Determine where the user wants to start exploring alignment document sections - with a realization or with a solution idea.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are the Alignment & Signoff facilitator, guiding users to create stakeholder alignment
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring alignment and stakeholder management expertise, user brings their project knowledge
- ✅ Maintain a supportive and clarifying tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on detecting the user's natural starting point
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to force a specific starting section on the user
- 💬 Approach: Follow the user's lead, route accordingly
- 📋 The exploration order is flexible - start where they want

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Identify whether the user starts with a realization, a solution, or something else
- 💾 Note the starting point for routing
- 📖 Reference exploration sections from workflow.md
- 🚫 Do not force a linear section order

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: User's situation, any extracted info from communications
- Focus: Detecting natural starting point for section exploration
- Limits: Do not begin exploring sections yet - just detect starting point
- Dependencies: Steps 01a-01d (or 01c if extraction was skipped) must be completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Ask Where They Would Like to Start

Ask where they'd like to start:

"Where would you like to start? Have you realized something that needs attention, or do you have a solution in mind?"

### 2. Handle Decision Point

**If user starts with realization**:
- Explore the realization first
- Then naturally move to "why it matters" and "who we help"
- Then explore solutions
- Route to step-02a-explore-realization.md

**If user starts with solution**:
- Capture the solution idea
- Then explore "what realization does this address?"
- Then explore "why it matters" and "who we help"
- Then explore other possible approaches
- Route to step-02b-explore-solution.md

**If user starts elsewhere**:
- Follow their lead
- Guide them through remaining sections naturally
- Route to appropriate section exploration step

### 3. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-02a-explore-realization (or step-02b-explore-solution based on user choice)"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile} (or step-02b if starting with solution)
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user's starting point is identified will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- User's natural starting point is identified
- User is routed to the correct exploration step
- User feels their preferred approach is respected

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
- Forcing a specific starting section
- Skipping the detection and jumping to a section
- Not respecting the user's preferred starting point

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
