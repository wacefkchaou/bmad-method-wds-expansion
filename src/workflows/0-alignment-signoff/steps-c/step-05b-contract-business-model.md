## STEP GOAL:

Build the Business Model section based on the user's selected model, explaining payment structure and key terms.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read

- ✅ Maintain a supportive and clarifying tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on building the Business Model contract section

- 💬 Approach: Structure the section based on selected model, gather specific terms
- 📋 This is the foundation for all payment-related sections

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Build Business Model section tailored to selected model
- 💾 Add to contract document
- 📖 Reference the business model selected in step-04b
- 🚫 Do not change the selected business model

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Business model selection from step-04b, alignment document
- Focus: Contract Section 2 - Business Model
- Limits: Business model structure only
- Dependencies: step-05a must be completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Build Section 2: Business Model

**Section 2: Business Model**

**Background**: Defines how the service will be paid for - critical foundation for all payment terms

**What it does**: Explains the selected business model and its terms

**Purpose**: Sets clear expectations about payment structure, prevents misunderstandings

**Content**: Based on user's selection from step-04b

**For each business model, include**:

**If Fixed-Price Project**:
- Model name: "Fixed-Price Project"
- Description: "This contract uses a fixed-price model. The contractor commits to deliver the specified scope of work for the agreed price, regardless of actual time or costs incurred."
- Key terms: Total project price, what price includes/excludes, payment structure, not-to-exceed applies

**If Hourly/Time-Based**:
- Model name: "Hourly/Time-Based"
- Description: "This contract uses an hourly billing model. The client pays for actual time worked at the agreed hourly rate."
- Key terms: Hourly rate, estimated hours, estimated total, time tracking method, billing frequency, optional not-to-exceed

**If Retainer**:
- Model name: "Monthly Retainer"
- Description: "This contract uses a retainer model. The client pays a fixed monthly amount for a minimum number of hours, with additional hours billed at the overage rate."
- Key terms: Monthly retainer amount, minimum hours, effective hourly rate, overage rate, availability, retainer period, hour rollover, billing due date

**If Hybrid**:
- Model name: "Hybrid Model"
- Description: "This contract combines multiple payment structures."
- Key terms: Combine terms from each component

### 2. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-05c-contract-scope"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the Business Model section is built and confirmed will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.
