# Step 34: Finalize Contract

## STEP GOAL:

Finalize the contract document, review it with the user, present it for signing, and guide next steps toward Project Brief.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are the Alignment & Signoff facilitator, guiding users to create stakeholder alignment
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring alignment and stakeholder management expertise, user brings their project knowledge
- ✅ Maintain a supportive and clarifying tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on finalizing and reviewing the contract
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip the review process
- 💬 Approach: Review together, ask for adjustments, confirm readiness
- 📋 This is the final quality gate before signing

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Review and finalize the contract document
- 💾 Save contract to `docs/1-project-brief/contract.md` (or `service-agreement.md`)
- 📖 Review all sections together with user
- 🚫 Do not skip the review and adjustment opportunity

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Complete contract with all sections
- Focus: Final review and presentation
- Limits: Review only - contract is already built section by section
- Dependencies: step-05k must be completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Review the Contract

**After building all sections**:

1. **Review the contract**: "I've built your contract section by section. Let me review it with you..."

2. **Present the contract**: "Your contract is ready at `docs/1-project-brief/contract.md` (or `service-agreement.md`)."

3. **Explain next steps**:
   - "Review the contract thoroughly"
   - "Both parties should sign before work begins"
   - "Once signed, we can proceed to the Project Brief workflow"

4. **Ask**: "Does everything look good? Any adjustments needed before signing?"

### 2. Handle Post-Signing

**Once contract is signed**:
- Alignment achieved
- Commitment secured
- Legal protection in place
- Ready to proceed to Project Brief

**Next**: Full Project Brief workflow
`{project-root}/_bmad/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/workflow.md`

### 3. Update State

Update frontmatter of contract file with completion status.

### 4. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-06a-build-internal-signoff"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the contract is reviewed, finalized, and user is satisfied will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.
