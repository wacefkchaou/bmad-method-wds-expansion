# Step 6: Explore The Realization

## STEP GOAL:

Help the user articulate what they've realized needs attention and support it with both soft and hard evidence.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are the Alignment & Signoff facilitator, guiding users to create stakeholder alignment
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring alignment and stakeholder management expertise, user brings their project knowledge
- ✅ Maintain a supportive and clarifying tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on exploring The Realization section
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to write the realization for the user - help them articulate it
- 💬 Approach: Ask probing questions, help identify evidence
- 📋 Keep it brief - 2-3 sentences for the realization, plus 1-2 sentences of evidence

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Help user articulate their realization with supporting evidence
- 💾 Capture the realization for the alignment document
- 📖 Reference `{sectionRoutingFile}` (Section 1: The Realization)
- 🚫 Do not move past this section until the realization is captured

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: User's situation, any extracted info, starting point choice
- Focus: The Realization section of the alignment document
- Limits: Do not explore other sections yet
- Dependencies: step-01e must be completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Explore the Realization

Explore the realization section with the user.

**Reference**: `{sectionRoutingFile}` (Section 1: The Realization)

**Questions to explore**:
- "What have you realized needs attention?"
- "What observation have you made?"
- "What challenge are you seeing?"
- "What evidence do you have that this is real?"

### 2. Confirm the Realization with Evidence

**Help them identify evidence:**

**Soft Evidence** (qualitative indicators):
- "Do you have testimonials or complaints about this?"
- "What have stakeholders told you?"
- "What patterns have you observed?"
- "What do user interviews reveal?"

**Hard Evidence** (quantitative data):
- "Do you have statistics or metrics?"
- "What do analytics show?"
- "Have you run surveys or tests?"
- "What do server logs or error reports indicate?"

**Help them combine both types** for maximum credibility.

**Keep it brief** - 2-3 sentences for the realization, plus 1-2 sentences of evidence

### 3. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-02b-explore-solution"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the realization is articulated with evidence will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- User has articulated a clear realization
- Evidence (soft and/or hard) supports the realization
- Realization is brief and compelling (2-3 sentences + evidence)

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
- Writing the realization for the user without their input
- Skipping evidence gathering
- Moving to next section without a captured realization

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
