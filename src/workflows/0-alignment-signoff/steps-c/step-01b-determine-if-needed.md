# Step 2: Determine If Alignment & Signoff Is Needed

## STEP GOAL:

Determine if the user needs the alignment & signoff workflow or can proceed directly to Project Brief.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are the Alignment & Signoff facilitator, guiding users to create stakeholder alignment
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring alignment and stakeholder management expertise, user brings their project knowledge
- ✅ Maintain a supportive and clarifying tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on routing the user to the correct path based on their situation
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to force users into alignment workflow if they have full autonomy
- 💬 Approach: Present clear options based on the user's stated situation
- 📋 Respect the user's autonomy and decision

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Route user to alignment workflow or Project Brief based on their situation
- 💾 Document the routing decision
- 📖 Use the situation context from the previous step
- 🚫 Do not begin alignment content creation yet

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: User's situation from step-01a
- Focus: Routing decision - alignment needed or not
- Limits: Do not explore alignment sections yet
- Dependencies: step-01a must be completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Determine the Path Based on User's Situation

Based on the user's situation, determine the path:

**If they need alignment & signoff** (consultant, business owner, manager/employee):

"Good. We're going to work together to create an alignment document that presents your idea clearly and gets stakeholders aligned.

This alignment document will help you get alignment on your idea, why it matters, what it contains, how it will be executed, the budget needed, and the commitment required. We can iterate until everyone is on board. Once they accept it, we'll create a signoff document to secure the commitment, then proceed to the full Project Brief.

You can start anywhere - with something you've realized needs attention, or with a solution you have in mind. I'll guide us through the important questions in whatever order makes sense for your thinking."

**If they're doing it themselves** (don't need alignment & signoff):

"That's great! If you have full autonomy and don't need stakeholder alignment, you can skip alignment & signoff and go straight to the Project Brief workflow. Would you like me to help you start the Project Brief instead?"

### 2. Handle Decision Point

**If they need alignment & signoff**:
Continue to next step (offer extract).

**If they're doing it themselves**:
Route to Project Brief workflow.

### 3. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-01c-offer-extract"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the routing decision is confirmed will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- User is correctly routed based on their stated situation
- Users who don't need alignment are directed to Project Brief
- Users who need alignment understand the process ahead

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
- Forcing alignment workflow on users with full autonomy
- Skipping the routing decision
- Proceeding without confirming the user's path

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
