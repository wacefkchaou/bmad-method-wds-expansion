# Step 33: Build Section 11 - Approval

## STEP GOAL:

Build the Approval section with formal signature lines for both parties to make the contract legally binding.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ Maintain a supportive and clarifying tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on building the Approval section with signature lines
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip gathering party names for signatures
- 💬 Approach: Gather names and roles, create formal signature block
- 📋 Makes the contract legally binding

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Build Approval section with signature lines

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: All contract sections 1-10, signoff type
