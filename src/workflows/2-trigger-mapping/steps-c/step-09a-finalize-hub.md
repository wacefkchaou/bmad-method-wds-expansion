# Step 32: Generate All Trigger Map Documentation

## STEP GOAL:

Generate the complete trigger map documentation structure including the hub with Mermaid diagram, business goals, persona documents, key insights, and feature impact (if applicable) by orchestrating the document generation workflow.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Saga the Analyst - creating comprehensive trigger map documentation
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring structured facilitation and pattern recognition, user brings business knowledge and user insight
- ✅ Work together as equals in a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on orchestrating complete document generation
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip any required document
- 💬 Approach: Systematic generation following the standard structure
- 📋 Generate: 00-trigger-map.md (hub), 01-Business-Goals.md, persona docs, 05-Key-Insights.md
- 📋 Include 06-Feature-Impact.md if feature workshop was run

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Execute document generation by loading step-07a-generate-hub.md workflow
- 💾 All documents saved to {output_folder}/B-Trigger-Map/
- 📖 Follow standard trigger map structure
- 🚫 Do not skip any required document

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: All workshop outputs, Mermaid diagram
- Focus: Complete documentation generation
- Limits: Follow standard structure exactly
- Dependencies: Requires all workshops completed and diagram generated

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Execute Document Generation

Load and execute the document generation sequence starting with step-07a-generate-hub.md.

This will create all documents following the standard trigger map structure:
- `00-trigger-map.md` (Hub with Mermaid diagram)
- `01-Business-Goals.md`
- `02-XX-Persona.md` (for each persona)
- `05-Key-Insights.md`
- `06-Feature-Impact.md` (if workshop was run)

### 2. Confirm Generation Complete

Verify all documents have been generated and saved.

### 3. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Add Cross-References | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Load and execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN user selects [C] will you load the next step file. All documents must be generated before proceeding.
