# Step 36: Update Design Log

## STEP GOAL:

Document Phase 2: Trigger Mapping completion in the project design log, listing all artifacts created, key decisions made, and suggesting next steps.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Saga the Analyst - documenting completion for project memory
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring structured facilitation and pattern recognition, user brings business knowledge and user insight
- ✅ Work together as equals in a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on documenting completion in design log
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to use generic statements or "etc." - list every artifact
- 💬 Approach: Specific, detailed progress entry
- 📋 List every artifact file - do not summarize with "etc."
- 📋 Record key decisions if any were made

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Read current design log and append progress entry
- 💾 Update {output_folder}/_progress/00-progress.md
- 📖 List all artifacts and key decisions specifically
- 🚫 Do not overwrite existing entries

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: All completed artifacts, key decisions from workshops
- Focus: Design log update with specific details
- Limits: Append only - do not overwrite existing entries
- Dependencies: Requires handover package created

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Read Current Log

Read `{output_folder}/_progress/00-progress.md` to understand existing entries and format.

### 2. Append Progress Entry

Add under the `## Progress` section (after the last entry):

```
### [date] - Phase 2: Trigger Mapping Complete

**Agent:** Saga (Trigger Mapping)
**Personas:** [N] ([primary name], [secondary name], [tertiary name if exists])
**Business Goals:** [N]

**Artifacts Created:**
- B-Trigger-Map/00-trigger-map.md - Visual overview
- B-Trigger-Map/01-Business-Goals.md
- B-Trigger-Map/02-[primary].md
- B-Trigger-Map/03-[secondary].md
- [list ALL files created]

**Summary:** [2-3 sentences: personas identified, key strategic insights, feature priorities established]

**Next:** Phase 3 - UX Scenarios
```

**Rules:**
- List every artifact file - do not summarize with "etc."
- Summary must mention specific insights, not generic statements
- Use the actual date, not a placeholder

### 3. Record Key Decisions

Add rows to the `## Key Decisions` table for any significant choices made during Phase 2:

```
| [date] | [decision] | Phase 2: Trigger Mapping | Saga + [user_name] |
```

Examples: persona prioritization choices, business goal ranking, feature impact priorities, workshop mode selection.

If no significant decisions were made, skip this section.

### 4. Verify

- Progress entry appended (not overwriting existing entries)
- All artifact files listed
- Summary is specific, not generic
- Key decisions recorded (if any)

Output: "Design log updated. Phase 2: Trigger Mapping documented in _progress/00-progress.md"

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to UX Design Activation | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Load and execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN user selects [C] will you load the next step file. Design log must be updated before proceeding. Do NOT skip ahead.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:
- Design log read before updating
- Progress entry appended (not overwriting)
- All artifact files listed individually
- Summary is specific with real insights
- Key decisions recorded where applicable
- Actual date used
- Design log saved

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
- Overwriting existing entries
- Using "etc." instead of listing all files
- Generic summary statements
- Missing artifact files in list
- Using placeholder dates
- Not reading existing log first

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
