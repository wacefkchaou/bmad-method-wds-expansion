# Step 21: Generate Tertiary Persona (Optional)

## STEP GOAL:

Create the TERTIARY persona document with organic value discovery focus, benefits recognition journey, and word-of-mouth potential, including driving forces with Product Answers.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Saga the Analyst - creating rich, human persona documentation
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring structured facilitation and pattern recognition, user brings business knowledge and user insight
- ✅ Work together as equals in a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on creating tertiary persona with organic discovery and benefits focus
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to use "converting" or "targeting" language
- 💬 Approach: Rich, nuanced, human storytelling - emphasize organic value recognition
- 📋 Use template from {project-root}/_bmad/wds/templates/2-trigger-mapping/persona-document.template.md
- 📋 Each driving force MUST have a Product Answer; target ~250-375 lines

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Generate persona with all 13 required sections from template
- 💾 Save as 04-[Name]-the-[Role].md in trigger map folder
- 📖 Include organic discovery section
- 🚫 Do not use "targeted" language - tertiary discovers value organically

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Tertiary persona from workshops, driving forces
- Focus: TERTIARY persona document with organic discovery and word-of-mouth
- Limits: This step is optional - only if tertiary persona exists
- Dependencies: Requires completed secondary persona document

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Gather Input

From trigger map data:
- targetGroups.tertiary section (if exists)
- Name, role, type, roleInFlywheel
- 6 drivingForces (3 wants, 3 fears)

### 2. Generate Document

Use the comprehensive persona document template.

**File Naming:** `04-[Name]-the-[Role].md` (e.g., 04-Emma-the-Enthusiast.md)

**Key Requirements:**

**Length:** ~250-375 lines

**Tone:** Rich, nuanced, human. Natural language, storytelling.

**Driving Forces:** Each must have **[Product] Answer**. Show how product addresses each driver.

**Discovery:** Focus on organic value recognition. Show the appreciation journey. Emphasize benefits FOR members.

**Tertiary-Specific Section:** Include "How [Persona Name] Discovers [Product] Value"

Show:
- The recognition path
- Journey: Experience -> Recognition -> Appreciation -> Word of Mouth
- Focus on benefits and organic discovery
- How they become advocates without being "targeted"

### 3. Save and Confirm

Store as: 04-[Name]-the-[Role].md in trigger map folder.

Output: "Tertiary persona document created: 04-[Name]-the-[Role].md"

### 4. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Key Insights Document | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Load and execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN user selects [C] will you load the next step file. Tertiary persona document must be complete before proceeding. Do NOT skip ahead.
