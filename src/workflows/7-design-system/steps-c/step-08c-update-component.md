# Step 8c: Update Component

## STEP GOAL:

Update an existing component definition: identify update type, analyze impact, apply changes, track version history, notify affected pages.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are the Design System Architect guiding design system creation and maintenance
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design system expertise and component analysis, user brings design knowledge and project context
- ✅ Maintain systematic and analytical tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on this step's specific goal — do not skip ahead
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to jump to later steps before this step is complete
- 💬 Approach: Systematic execution with clear reporting
- 📋 All outputs must be documented and presented to user

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Execute each instruction in the sequence below
- 💾 Document all findings and decisions
- 📖 Present results to user before proceeding
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip instructions or optimize the sequence

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Previous step outputs and project configuration
- Focus: This step's specific goal only
- Limits: Do not perform actions belonging to subsequent steps
- Dependencies: Requires all previous steps to be completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

## Step 1: Identify Update Type

<action>
Determine what's being updated:
</action>

**Update Types:**

### Type A: Add New State

Adding state to all variants (e.g., loading, error, success)

### Type B: Update Styling

Changing visual properties (colors, sizing, spacing)

### Type C: Update Behavior

Changing interactions, animations, or keyboard support

### Type D: Update Accessibility

Adding/modifying ARIA attributes or screen reader support

### Type E: Update Documentation

Clarifying usage, adding examples, fixing errors

### Type F: Refactor

Reorganizing component structure, splitting/merging variants

<ask>
```
What type of update is this?

[A] Add new state
[B] Update styling
[C] Update behavior
[D] Update accessibility
[E] Update documentation
[F] Refactor component

Your choice:

```
</ask>

---

## Step 2: Load Current Component

<action>
Read existing component file:
- Current definition
- All variants
- Current states
- Current styling
- Usage tracking
</action>

<output>
```

📖 Loaded Button [btn-001]

Current state:

- Variants: 3 (primary, secondary, navigation)
- States: default, hover, active, disabled
- Used in: 9 pages
- Last updated: 2024-12-09

```
</output>

---

## Step 3: Analyze Impact

<action>
Determine impact of update:
</action>

**Impact Assessment:**

### Scope
- All variants affected?
- Specific variant only?
- All instances affected?
- Specific usage only?

### Breaking Changes
- Does this change existing behavior?
- Will existing pages need updates?
- Does this affect developers?

### Compatibility
- Compatible with current usage?
- Requires page spec updates?
- Requires code changes?

<output>
```

📊 Impact Analysis:

Update: Adding "loading" state to all button variants

Scope: All variants (primary, secondary, navigation)
Affected Pages: 9 pages using Button component
Breaking Change: No (additive only)
Compatibility: Fully compatible (optional state)

Impact Level: Low (safe to proceed)

```
</output>

---

## Step 4: Confirm Update

<ask>
```

Ready to update Button [btn-001]

Update: Add "loading" state
Impact: 9 pages (no breaking changes)

This will:
✓ Add loading state to component definition
✓ Update all variant documentation
✓ Maintain backward compatibility

Proceed with update? (y/n)

- default
- hover
- active
- disabled
````

**This operation updates a component. Changes apply to all future usage automatically.**
```

### 10. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue or [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#10-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects the appropriate option
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN [component is updated, version history tracked, and affected pages notified], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute the next step.

---

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step goal achieved completely
- All instructions executed in sequence
- Results documented and presented to user
- User confirmed before proceeding
- Agent dialog updated

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipping any instruction in the sequence
- Generating content without user input
- Jumping ahead to later steps
- Not presenting results to user
- Proceeding without user confirmation

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
