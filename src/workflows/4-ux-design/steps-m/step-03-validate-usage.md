# Step 3: Validate Component Usage

## STEP GOAL:

Check that design system components are used correctly and consistently across page specifications. Identify and resolve inconsistencies.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on cross-referencing components between design system and page specs
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to modify components without user approval
- 💬 Approach: Scan, cross-reference, report, then resolve with user
- 📋 Generate a Component Usage Report table

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Scan page specifications, cross-reference with design system, generate report
- 💾 Update component definitions and page specs based on resolution decisions
- 📖 Reference all page specifications in `{output_folder}/D-UX-Design/`
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to auto-fix inconsistencies without user approval

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Design system components, all page specifications
- Focus: Usage validation and consistency
- Limits: Do not define new components (return to step 02 for that)
- Dependencies: Design system must have components defined

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Scan Page Specifications

Read all page specifications in `{output_folder}/D-UX-Design/` and extract component references.

### 2. Cross-Reference

For each component:
- Is it defined in the design system? (yes/no)
- Is it used consistently (same props/states)? (yes/warning)
- Are there conflicting definitions? (yes/no)

### 3. Report

```
## Component Usage Report

| Component | Defined | Pages Used | Consistent | Issues |
|-----------|---------|------------|------------|--------|
| [name] | yes/no | [N] | yes/warning | [details] |

**Missing from system:** [list]
**Inconsistent usage:** [list]
**Unused components:** [list]
```

### 4. Resolve

For each issue:
- Update component definition to match usage
- Update page specifications to match design system
- Remove orphaned components

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#5-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and the usage report has been generated and issues resolved will you proceed accordingly. This is the last step in the Design System activity.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- All page specifications scanned
- Cross-reference completed for all components
- Component Usage Report generated
- Issues resolved with user approval
- Design system and page specs updated

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Not scanning all page specifications
- Auto-fixing inconsistencies without user approval
- Generating incomplete report
- Not resolving identified issues

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
