# Step 6: Validate Object Registry

## STEP GOAL:

Verify that page specification includes complete Object Registry with 100% coverage of all Object IDs defined in Page Sections.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on 100% Object ID coverage between Page Sections and Object Registry
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to accept coverage below 100% without user acknowledgment
- 💬 Approach: Extract all Object IDs from sections, cross-reference with registry, report gaps
- 📋 Object Registry is the single source of truth for all page elements

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Cross-reference Object IDs between Page Sections and Object Registry
- 💾 Update Object Registry if additions are approved by user
- 📖 Reference Page Sections for complete Object ID extraction
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip orphaned Object ID detection

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Page specification (Page Sections and Object Registry)
- Focus: Object Registry coverage validation only
- Limits: Do not validate Object ID correctness (that is step 04)
- Dependencies: Page Sections must be validated (step 04)

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Check Object Registry Section

Check for "## Object Registry" header. Verify introduction paragraph exists. Extract all Object IDs from Page Sections and compare against Object Registry table(s).

Validate:
- "## Object Registry" header present
- Introduction paragraph explaining registry purpose
- Master Object List table(s) with all Object IDs
- Proper table formatting (Object ID | Type | Description)
- Consistent naming conventions

### 2. Calculate Coverage

Calculate coverage percentage:
- Identify missing Object IDs (in sections but not in registry)
- Identify orphaned Object IDs (in registry but not in sections)

### 3. Generate Diagnostic Report

If Object Registry section is missing, report as CRITICAL. If coverage is below 100%, report as CRITICAL. If table formatting is incorrect, report as WARNING.

Generate diagnostic report showing coverage percentage, missing Object IDs, orphaned Object IDs, and provide example of correct registry format.

### 4. Resolve Issues

If issues found, present to user and ask if they want you to update the Object Registry.

### 5. Record Validation Result

```yaml
object_registry_validated:
  registry_section_present: [true/false]
  introduction_paragraph_present: [true/false]
  table_properly_formatted: [true/false]
  coverage_percentage: [0-100]
  all_object_ids_registered: [true/false]
  no_orphaned_ids: [true/false]
  naming_conventions_consistent: [true/false]
  status: [pass/warning/critical]
```

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Validate Design System Separation | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#6-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and the object registry validation is complete will you proceed to the next step or return as directed.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Object Registry section checked for presence and format
- All Object IDs extracted from Page Sections
- Cross-reference completed with coverage percentage calculated
- Missing and orphaned Object IDs identified
- Diagnostic report generated
- Issues resolved with user approval

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Not extracting all Object IDs from Page Sections
- Skipping orphaned Object ID detection
- Accepting coverage below 100% without user acknowledgment
- Auto-fixing registry without user approval
- Proceeding without recording validation result

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
