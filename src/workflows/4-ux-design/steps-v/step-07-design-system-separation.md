# Step 7: Validate Design System Separation & Unnecessary Information

## STEP GOAL:

Verify that page specification focuses on strategic design intent without CSS implementation details, and contains no unnecessary information like code snippets, version control notes, or duplicate content.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on detecting CSS details, code snippets, and unnecessary information
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip scanning for hex codes, pixel values, or CSS classes
- 💬 Approach: Systematic scan for implementation details, report with line numbers
- 📋 Page specs focus on WHAT/WHY (strategic), not HOW (implementation)

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Scan entire document for CSS implementation details and unnecessary information
- 💾 Update page specification if removals are approved by user
- 📖 Reference Design System for where styling information should live
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to auto-remove content without user approval

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Page specification, design system
- Focus: Design system separation and unnecessary information only
- Limits: Do not validate content quality or structure (covered by other steps)
- Dependencies: Page specification must exist

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Scan for CSS Implementation Details

Scan entire document for:
- CSS classes (e.g., `.button-primary`)
- Hex codes (e.g., `#FF5733`)
- Pixel values (e.g., `16px`)
- Font size specifications (e.g., `font-size: 14px`)
- Padding, margins, or layout measurements
- Styling implementation details

Verify that:
- Component references properly link to Design System
- Color/typography references use Design System tokens

### 2. Scan for Unnecessary Information

Scan for:
- Implementation code snippets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Developer instructions or technical setup steps
- Version control information (commit messages, PR notes)
- Internal project management notes
- Duplicate content across sections
- Outdated/deprecated information
- Design iteration history

### 3. Generate Diagnostic Report

If CSS details found, report as CRITICAL. If unnecessary information found, report as WARNING.

Generate diagnostic report showing all violations with line numbers, explain why each is problematic, and provide recommendations for where information should live instead (Design System for styling, separate docs for setup, etc.).

### 4. Resolve Issues

If issues found, present to user and ask if they want you to remove or relocate the flagged content.

### 5. Record Validation Result

```yaml
design_system_separation_validated:
  no_css_classes: [true/false]
  no_hex_codes: [true/false]
  no_pixel_values: [true/false]
  no_styling_details: [true/false]
  component_references_present: [true/false]
  design_system_tokens_used: [true/false]
  no_code_snippets: [true/false]
  no_version_control_info: [true/false]
  no_duplicate_content: [true/false]
  no_outdated_information: [true/false]
  status: [pass/warning/critical]
```

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Validate SEO Compliance | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#6-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and the design system separation validation is complete will you proceed to the next step or return as directed.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Entire document scanned for CSS implementation details
- Hex codes, pixel values, and CSS classes detected
- Unnecessary information identified (code snippets, version control, duplicates)
- Diagnostic report generated with line numbers
- Issues resolved with user approval
- Validation result recorded

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Not scanning for hex codes, pixel values, or CSS classes
- Missing code snippets or implementation details
- Not checking for duplicate content
- Auto-removing content without user approval
- Proceeding without recording validation result

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
