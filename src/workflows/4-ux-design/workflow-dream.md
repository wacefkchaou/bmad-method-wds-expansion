# [D] Dream Up — Agent Creates Autonomously, User Reviews

**Goal:** The agent creates a complete scenario flow autonomously, then presents the result for user review.

**When to use:** When the user trusts the agent to make good decisions and prefers to review a complete proposal rather than approve each step.

---

## Entry

Load scenario context from `{output_folder}/C-UX-Scenarios/`.

## Process

The Dream workflow uses the same steps as Suggest (`./steps-s/`) but with **autonomous execution**:

1. **Agent executes all scenario setup steps** (step-01 through step-07) without pausing
2. **Agent creates all pages** (step-08 through step-15) for each page in the flow
3. **Agent presents the complete result** for user review

### Agent Behavior

- Make reasonable decisions at each step based on VTC, scenario context, and WDS patterns
- Document decisions and rationale as you go
- When uncertain, choose the simpler option
- After completion, present a summary of all decisions made
- User can accept, request changes, or switch to **[S] Suggest** for finer control

**Reference data:**
- `./data/scenario-init/` — scenario guides and examples
- `./data/page-creation-flows/` — page creation approaches

## After Completion

Present complete scenario for review. User can:
- Accept the scenario as-is
- Request specific changes
- Switch to **[S] Suggest** for step-by-step refinement
- Proceed to **[P] Specify** for individual pages
