# [S] Suggest — Agent Proposes, User Confirms Each Step

**Goal:** Build a scenario's page flow step by step, with the agent proposing and the user confirming at each stage.

**When to use:** When the user wants collaborative control — the agent suggests, the user approves or adjusts before moving on.
