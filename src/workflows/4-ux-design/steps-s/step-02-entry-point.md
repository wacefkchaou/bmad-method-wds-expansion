# Step 2: Entry Point

## STEP GOAL:

Determine where the user first encounters this scenario — their entry point into the experience.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on identifying the user's entry point for this scenario
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to define mental state or success criteria yet
- 💬 Approach: Explore external vs internal entry points
- 📋 This is question 2 of 5 in Scenario Discovery

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Guide user to identify entry point through examples and context
- 💾 Store the entry_point value for use in subsequent steps
- 📖 Reference core_feature from previous step for context
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip user confirmation

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: core_feature from step 01
- Focus: How users arrive at this scenario
- Limits: Do not define mental state or success criteria yet
- Dependencies: core_feature must be captured

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Identify Entry Point

**Scenario Discovery - Question 2 of 5**

<ask>**Where does the user first encounter this?**

What's their entry point?
- Google search?
- Friend recommendation?
- App store?
- Direct navigation (logged in)?
- Internal link from another feature?
- Email/push notification?
- External integration?

Entry point:</ask>

<action>Store entry_point</action>
<template-output>entry_point</template-output>

### 2. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Mental State | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#2-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and the entry point has been captured will you proceed to the next step or return as directed.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Entry point identified through user input
- Entry point is specific (not vague)
- entry_point stored for subsequent steps

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Generating or assuming the entry point without user input
- Skipping to mental state before entry point is identified
- Proceeding without storing entry_point

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
