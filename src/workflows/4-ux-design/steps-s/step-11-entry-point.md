# Step 11: Page Entry Point

## STEP GOAL:

Define where users arrive from for this specific page — the page-level entry points (distinct from scenario-level entry point in step 02).

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on page-level entry points (how users get to THIS page)
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to define page mental state or outcomes yet
- 💬 Approach: Explore both external and internal navigation paths
- 📋 Include both external (Google, ads) and internal (nav menu, previous page) sources

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Ask for page entry points with both external and internal examples
- 💾 Store entry_point for this page
- 📖 Reference page_purpose for context
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without confirmed entry points

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Scenario data, page_name, page_purpose
- Focus: How users navigate to this specific page
- Limits: Do not define mental state or outcomes yet
- Dependencies: page_purpose must be captured

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Define Page Entry Points

<ask>**Where do users arrive from?**

How do users get to this page?

Examples:
- Google search (external)
- Social media ad (external)
- Email link (external)
- QR code (external)
- Navigation menu (internal)
- Previous page in flow (internal)
- Direct URL (bookmark)

Entry point(s):</ask>

<action>Store entry_point</action>
<template-output>entry_point</template-output>

### 2. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Page Mental State | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#2-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and entry_point has been captured will you proceed to the next step or return as directed.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Page-level entry points identified through user input
- Both external and internal sources considered
- entry_point stored for subsequent steps

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Generating entry points without user input
- Confusing page-level with scenario-level entry points
- Proceeding without storing entry_point

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
