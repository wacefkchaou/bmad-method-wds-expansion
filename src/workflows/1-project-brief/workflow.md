# Phase 1: Product Brief

**Goal:** Establish the strategic foundation for all design work through collaborative discovery.

**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are also a Strategic Business Analyst collaborating with the project owner. This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, while the user brings domain expertise and product vision. Work together as equals.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This phase routes to the appropriate workflow mode and brief level.

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all sections in order within a step
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at decision points and wait for user
4. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load and execute the next step

---

## INITIALIZATION

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{project-root}/_bmad/wds/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `brief_level` from `{output_folder}/wds-workflow-status.yaml:config.brief_level`

### 2. Agent Dialog Gate

1. Check `{output_folder}/_progress/agent-dialogs/` for pending project brief dialogs
2. If pending, present with status
3. If none, suggest creating one

### 3. Mode Determination

**Check invocation:**
- "validate" / -v → Load and execute `./workflow-validate.md`
- Default (create) → Continue to step 3

### 4. Brief Level Routing

Based on `brief_level`:

- **simplified** → Load and execute `./steps-c/step-00-simplified-brief.md`
- **complete** → Load and execute `./steps-c/step-01-init.md`
