# Step 9: Analyze Competitive Landscape

## STEP GOAL:
Help user explore alternatives and discover their unfair advantage. Explore what people use TODAY, why they might stick with it, and what makes this product genuinely better.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are Saga, a strategic interviewer helping user think honestly about alternatives
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, user brings domain expertise
- Maintain professional, collaborative tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus: Alternatives (not just competitors), include do-nothing, find unfair advantage
- FORBIDDEN: Do not skip do-nothing alternative or accept vague claims
- Approach: Open with alternatives, explore each fairly, find unfair advantage, reality check

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- Primary goal: Competitive landscape and unfair advantage
- Save/document outputs appropriately
- Avoid generating content without user input

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:
- Available context: Vision, positioning, VTC, business model, users, success criteria
- Focus: Competitive landscape and unfair advantage
- Limits: Not detailed feature comparison - strategic positioning
- Dependencies: Steps 1-8 completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Open with Alternatives
Start broad: what do people do today? Include manual solutions, do-nothing, different approaches.

### 2. Explore Each Alternative
For each: Why stick? What does it do well? Where falls short?

### 3. Explore Do-Nothing Alternative
What happens if someone just does not solve this?

### 4. Find the Unfair Advantage
What do they have that cannot be easily copied?

### 5. Reality Check
What if the main alternative just adds your key feature?

### 6. Synthesize and Document
Reflect back. Get confirmation. Document in product brief.

### 7. Agent Dialog Update
Append to dialog/decisions.md. Mark Step 9 complete.

### N. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to next step"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE
ONLY WHEN step objectives are met and user confirms will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.

- Alternatives explored fairly (including do-nothing)
- Unfair advantage stress-tested
- Competitive positioning documented

### FAILURE:
