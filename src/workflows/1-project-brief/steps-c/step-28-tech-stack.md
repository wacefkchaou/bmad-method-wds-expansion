# Step 28: Technology Stack

## STEP GOAL:
Capture core technology decisions for the project including CMS/framework, frontend, styling, and hosting.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Strategic Business Analyst guiding technology choices with clear trade-off explanations
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, user brings domain expertise and product vision
- Maintain collaborative and strategic tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus: CMS/Framework, frontend tech, styling approach, hosting decisions
- FORBIDDEN: Do not recommend technology without explaining trade-offs at user's technical level
- Approach: Present options with trade-offs, explain at appropriate level, document rationale

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- Primary goal: Technology stack documented with rationale
- Save/document outputs appropriately
- Avoid generating content without user input

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:
- Available context: Product Brief, platform initialization, user's technical level
- Focus: Core technology choices
- Limits: Strategic technology direction, not detailed implementation
- Dependencies: Step 27 completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. CMS/Framework Selection

If not already decided, ask:
- "What type of site are we building?" (reference Product Brief)
- Present options appropriate to project:
  - **WordPress** - Content-focused, client can update, huge ecosystem
  - **Next.js/React** - Dynamic, app-like, developer-maintained
  - **Static (HTML/11ty)** - Simple, fast, minimal maintenance
  - **Other** - Based on specific requirements

### 2. Theme/Styling Approach

For WordPress:
- **Block Theme (Gutenberg)** - Modern, visual editing, limited flexibility
- **Classic Theme + Tailwind** - Developer control, Tailwind utility classes
- **Classic Theme + Custom CSS** - Full control, more maintenance
- **Existing Theme** - Faster start, less unique

For React/Next:
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first, rapid development
- **CSS Modules** - Component-scoped styles
- **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS approach

### 3. Document Rationale
- Why this choice fits the project
- Trade-offs acknowledged
- Client maintenance implications

### 4. Capture in Template
- Fill in Technology Stack section of output document

### 5. Agent Dialog Update
After completing this step, update the agent dialog:

```markdown
### Step 28: Technology Stack
**Q:** CMS/framework, styling approach, hosting?
**A:** [User responses - summarized]
**Documented in:** platform-requirements.md (Technology Stack section)
**Key insights:** [Important decisions or revelations]
**Status:** Complete
**Timestamp:** [HH:MM]
```

### N. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to next step"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE
ONLY WHEN step objectives are met and user confirms will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.

## SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### SUCCESS:
- CMS/framework choice documented with rationale
- Styling approach defined
- Trade-offs acknowledged
- Client maintenance implications noted
- User confirmed

### FAILURE:
- Recommended technology without trade-off explanation
- Used overly technical language for non-technical user
- Generated tech stack without user input

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
