# Step 19: Inspiration Analysis Workshop

## STEP GOAL:
Analyze reference sites with the client to document concrete visual/UX preferences.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Strategic Business Analyst facilitating inspiration analysis with the client
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, user brings domain expertise and product vision
- Maintain collaborative and strategic tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus: Collect references, analyze together, synthesize design principles
- FORBIDDEN: Do not assume preferences - always ask WHY the client likes something
- Approach: Collect URLs, analyze each together, extract principles, synthesize patterns
- **Load agent guide:** `src/data/agent-guides/saga/inspiration-analysis.md` for full strategic context

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- Primary goal: Reference sites analyzed with concrete preferences documented
- Save/document outputs appropriately
- Avoid generating content without user input

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:
- Available context: Product Brief, Content & Language document
- Focus: Visual and UX inspiration analysis
- Limits: Document preferences, not design solutions
- Dependencies: Steps 1-18 completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Collect Reference URLs

Ask client for 2-4 sites they find inspiring. Can be competitors, sites with appealing style, or sites with UX patterns they like.

If client has no references, offer to find examples in their industry.

### 2. Analyze Each Site Together

For each site:
- Load/screenshot the site using browser tools or WebFetch
- Ask open-ended first: "What drew you to this site?"
- Probe specific elements visible on the site
- Capture reactions with the WHY (not just like/dislike)
- Extract principles as patterns emerge

### 3. Synthesize Design Principles

After all sites:
- Organize findings by category (layout, content, visual, UX)
- Identify patterns across sites
- Confirm synthesis with client

### 4. Document

Create `inspiration-analysis.md` in the Product Brief output folder using the template at `{project-root}/_bmad/wds/templates/1-project-brief/inspiration-analysis.template.md`.

### 5. Agent Dialog Integration

Follow the same agent dialog pattern as other PB workflows:
- Create/update dialog entry for this workshop
- Document key questions, answers, and insights
- Note which elements were liked/disliked and why

### N. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to next step"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE
ONLY WHEN step objectives are met and user confirms will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.

## SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### SUCCESS:
- 2-4 reference sites collected and analyzed
- Specific preferences documented with WHY
- Design principles synthesized from patterns
- Client confirmed the synthesis
- Documented in inspiration-analysis.md

### FAILURE:
- Assumed preferences without asking
- Only captured "like/dislike" without the WHY
- Generated design principles without client collaboration

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
