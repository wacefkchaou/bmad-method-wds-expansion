# Step 29: Integrations & Plugins

## STEP GOAL:
Document required integrations, plugins, and third-party services.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Strategic Business Analyst capturing integration requirements and plugin needs
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, user brings domain expertise and product vision
- Maintain collaborative and strategic tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus: Required plugins, external services, API connections, analytics, future plans
- FORBIDDEN: Do not skip asking about future integration plans
- Approach: Walk through common integration categories, capture needs and account ownership

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- Primary goal: Integrations and plugin stack documented
- Save/document outputs appropriately
- Avoid generating content without user input

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:
- Available context: Product Brief, technology stack
- Focus: Third-party integrations and plugin requirements
- Limits: Requirements, not implementation details
- Dependencies: Step 28 completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Identify Required Integrations

Ask about common needs:
- "Will you need any of these?"
  - **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.
  - **Maps:** Google Maps for location
  - **Forms:** Contact forms, booking systems
  - **Email:** Newsletter, transactional email
  - **Social:** Social media feeds, sharing
  - **Payment:** If e-commerce
  - **CRM:** Customer relationship management

### 2. For Each Integration, Capture:
- What it does
- Why it's needed
- Any specific requirements
- Account ownership (client or developer?)

### 3. Plugin Stack (if WordPress)

Recommend standard stack:
- **SEO:** Rank Math or Yoast
- **Multilingual:** Polylang or WPML (if needed)
- **Performance:** Caching, image optimization
- **Security:** Firewall, backup
- **Forms:** Contact Form 7, WPForms, etc.

### 4. Future Integrations

Ask: "Are there any integrations you might want in the future?"
- Document these for planning
- Note any architecture implications

### 5. Update Output Document
- Fill in Integrations section
- Fill in Plugin/Package Stack section

### 6. Agent Dialog Update
After completing this step, update the agent dialog:

```markdown
### Step 29: Integrations & Plugins
**Q:** Required integrations, plugin stack, future plans?
**A:** [User responses - summarized]
**Documented in:** platform-requirements.md (Integrations section)
**Key insights:** [Important decisions or revelations]
**Status:** Complete
**Timestamp:** [HH:MM]
```

### N. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to next step"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE
ONLY WHEN step objectives are met and user confirms will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.

## SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### SUCCESS:
- Required integrations identified
- Account ownership documented for each
- Plugin stack recommended (if applicable)
- Future integration plans captured
- User confirmed

### FAILURE:
- Skipped future integration planning
- Generated integration list without user input
- Did not capture account ownership

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
