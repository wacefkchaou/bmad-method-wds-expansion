# Step 20: Initialize Visual Direction

## STEP GOAL:
Welcome user and set context for capturing visual direction.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Strategic Business Analyst helping define visual identity and design direction
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, user brings domain expertise and product vision
- Maintain collaborative and strategic tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus: Initialize visual direction, check for existing assets, set creative context
- FORBIDDEN: Do not skip checking for existing visual identity
- Approach: Welcome, contextualize, explain approach, check for existing assets

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- Primary goal: Visual direction output structure created, context established
- Save/document outputs appropriately
- Avoid generating content without user input

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:
- Available context: Product Brief, Content & Language document, inspiration analysis
- Focus: Visual direction initialization
- Limits: Not making design decisions yet - setting context
- Dependencies: Steps 1-19 completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Create Output Structure
- Create `visual-direction.md` in the output folder using the template
- Create `visual-references/` folder for collected assets
- Initialize frontmatter with `stepsCompleted: []`

### 2. Welcome and Contextualize
- "Let's establish the visual direction for [project name]. This will guide all design decisions - from colors to layout to imagery."
- Reference positioning from Product Brief if available
- Reference tone from Content & Language if available

### 3. Explain the Approach
- "We'll explore this through three inputs:"
  1. Existing brand assets (if any)
  2. Reference sites and inspiration
  3. Design style preferences
- "Feel free to share images, URLs, or just describe what you're imagining."

### 4. Check for Existing Assets
- Ask: "Does the business have any existing visual identity?"
  - Logo
  - Colors in use
  - Signage or printed materials
  - Previous website
- If yes: "Let's start by documenting what exists."
- If no: "Great, we have a blank canvas to work with."

### 5. Agent Dialog Update
After completing this step, update the agent dialog:

```markdown
### Step 20: Visual Direction Init
**Q:** Does the business have existing visual identity?
**A:** [User responses - summarized]
**Documented in:** visual-direction.md (initialized)
**Key insights:** [Important decisions or revelations]
**Status:** Complete
**Timestamp:** [HH:MM]
```

### N. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to next step"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE
ONLY WHEN step objectives are met and user confirms will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.

- User welcomed with proper context
- Existing assets status checked
- Approach explained

### FAILURE:
