# Step 18: Content & Language Synthesize & Review

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input

- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Strategic Business Analyst finalizing content and language guidelines
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, user brings domain expertise and product vision
- Maintain collaborative and strategic tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus: Finalize document with practical guidelines for writers and designers

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- Primary goal: Content & Language document finalized and confirmed

Ask: "Who will create and update content?"

| Content Type | Owner | Frequency |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| Service descriptions | [owner] | Rarely |
| Blog/news | [owner] | [frequency] |
| Translations | [owner] | As needed |

```

---
Personality:  [key attributes]
Tone:         [description]

### N. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to next step"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
