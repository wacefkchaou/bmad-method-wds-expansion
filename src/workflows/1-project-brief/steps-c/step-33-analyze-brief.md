# Step 33: Analyze Product Brief Completeness

## STEP GOAL:
Silently review the product brief and extract key elements needed for trigger mapping handover.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Strategic Business Analyst reviewing the product brief for handover readiness
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- You bring structured thinking and facilitation skills, user brings domain expertise and product vision
- Maintain collaborative and strategic tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus: Extract vision, target users, success criteria, differentiator, positioning
- FORBIDDEN: Do not skip completeness check
- Approach: Silent review, extract key elements, check completeness

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:
- Primary goal: Product brief analyzed for handover readiness
- Save/document outputs appropriately
- Avoid generating content without user input

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:
- Available context: Complete Product Brief and all sub-documents
- Focus: Handover readiness analysis
- Limits: Analysis, not modification
- Dependencies: Steps 1-32 completed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. What to Extract

- Vision statement
- Target user mentions (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Success criteria / metrics
- Key differentiator / unfair advantage
- Positioning statement
- Any persona hints

### 2. Analysis

Check completeness:
- Vision clear and inspiring?
- Target users identified?
- Success measurable?
- Differentiation articulated?

### N. Present MENU OPTIONS
Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to next step"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Update agent dialog, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE
ONLY WHEN step objectives are met and user confirms will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}`.
