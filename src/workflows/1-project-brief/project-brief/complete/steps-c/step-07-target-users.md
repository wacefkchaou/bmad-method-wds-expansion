# Step 6: Identify Target Users

## Purpose

Help user define their ideal customer profile.

## Context for Agent

You are identifying who the product is for and what their needs are. This information will guide all design decisions.

## Key Elements

This step identifies who we're designing for and what their needs are.

## Instructions

- User scenarios captured
- Reflection checkpoint (synthesis + user confirmation/correction)
- Primary user definition + secondary users (if applicable)

**Then:** Mark Step 7 complete in `dialog/README.md` progress tracker
