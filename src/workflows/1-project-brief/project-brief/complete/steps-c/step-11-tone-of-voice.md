# Step 11: Define Tone of Voice

## Purpose

Establish the product's communication personality and style for consistent UI microcopy and system messages throughout the product.

## Context for Agent

**Philosophy:** Don't ask the user to define tone of voice - YOU suggest appropriate attributes based on everything you've learned (users, positioning, context), then refine through conversation.

**Your role:** Strategic brand guide synthesizing the right voice from product context.

**Important:** Tone of Voice is for **UI microcopy** (buttons, labels, errors, system messages), NOT strategic content (headlines, feature descriptions, value propositions).

## Key Elements

### What is Tone of Voice?

Tone of Voice defines:
- **Brand personality:** Who are we as a company?
- **Communication style:** How do we speak to users?
- **Emotional tone:** What feeling do we create?
- **Voice attributes:** Friendly, professional, quirky, authoritative, empathetic, technical, casual, formal, playful, serious, etc.

### Tone of Voice vs Strategic Content

**Tone of Voice applies to:**
- ✅ Form field labels ("Email" vs "Email address" vs "Your email")
- ✅ Button text ("Submit" vs "Continue" vs "Let's go")
- ✅ Error messages ("Invalid email" vs "Hmm, that doesn't look like an email")
- ✅ System messages ("Loading..." vs "Hang tight..." vs "Processing your request")
- ✅ Empty states ("No items" vs "Nothing here yet" vs "Your list is empty")
- ✅ Tooltips and instructions

**Strategic Content uses:**
- ❌ Content Creation Workshop (purpose-driven, context-specific)
- ❌ Headlines, hero sections, feature descriptions
- ❌ Value propositions, testimonials, case studies

## Instructions

### 1. Analyze Product Context

Review what you've learned:
- Vision & positioning
- Target users and their characteristics
- Business model and customers
- Competitive landscape
- Product category and context

### 2. Suggest Tone of Voice Attributes

Based on the product context, suggest 3-5 tone attributes:

**Present in this format:**

```
Based on [brief reasoning from product context], I suggest this Tone of Voice:

Tone Attributes:
1. [Attribute 1]: [Brief explanation why]
2. [Attribute 2]: [Brief explanation why]
3. [Attribute 3]: [Brief explanation why]
4. [Attribute 4]: [Brief explanation why]

Does this feel aligned with your brand vision?
```

**Example attributes:**
- Friendly & approachable (for consumer products)
- Professional & authoritative (for B2B/enterprise)
- Empathetic & supportive (for healthcare, education)
- Playful & quirky (for creative/youth products)
- Technical & precise (for developer tools)
- Casual & conversational (for social apps)
- Warm & personal (for services)

### 3. Provide Examples

Show the tone in action with side-by-side comparisons. **See:** [substeps/11-output-template.md](substeps/11-output-template.md) for the example format.

### 4. Refine Based on Feedback

**Ask:**
- "Does this tone feel right for your brand?"
- "Should we adjust any attributes? (more/less formal, friendly, technical, etc.)"
- "Are the examples aligned with how you want to communicate?"

**Iterate until confirmed.**

### 5. Document Final Tone of Voice

Once confirmed, document:
- Tone attributes (3-5 clear characteristics)
- Example microcopy showing tone in action
- Do's and Don'ts (brief guidelines)

## Questions to Ask

### If User Needs Guidance:

**"Let me ask a few questions to help define the tone:"**

1. **Relationship:** "How do you want users to feel about your brand? Like a trusted advisor? A helpful friend? An expert authority? A fun companion?"

2. **Formality:** "Should communication be more formal and professional, or casual and conversational?"

3. **Personality:** "If your product were a person, how would they speak? (serious, playful, quirky, straightforward, warm, technical)"

4. **User Context:** "Are users typically stressed/frustrated when using your product, or excited/curious? How should tone respond to their state?"

5. **Differentiation:** "How do competitors communicate? Should you match industry standards or stand out with a different voice?"
