# Substep 1: Open Conversation

## Task

Introduce positioning naturally and invite user to think about how their product fits in the market.

## Instructions

### 1. Adapt Opening to Context

Reference `wds-project-outline.yaml` for:
- `project_context.stakes` - Affects tone
- `working_relationship.involvement_level` - Affects explanation depth

### 2. Opening Question (Choose Based on Context)

**If HIGH STAKES (enterprise/departmental):**
> "Let's talk about how you'll position {product} in the market. Positioning is critical for stakeholder buy-in - it defines who this is for, why it matters, and what makes it different from alternatives."
>
> "Tell me: Who are you building this for, and what makes it different?"

**If BALANCED STAKES (business):**
> "Let's figure out your positioning - basically, how you'll explain what {product} is and why someone should choose it over alternatives."
>
> "Start wherever feels natural: Who's this for? What problem does it solve? What makes it unique?"

**If LOW STAKES (personal/hobby):**
> "Let's nail down what makes {product} special!"
>
> "Who are you imagining using this, and why would they pick it over other options?"

### 3. Listen for Entry Point

User might start with:
- **Target customer** - "It's for busy parents..."
- **Problem** - "People struggle with..."
- **Differentiator** - "Unlike X, we..."
- **Category** - "It's like Notion but for..."

**All valid entry points.** Start where they start, fill in gaps later.

### 4. Set Conversational Tone

Use phrases like:
- "Tell me more about..."
- "Help me understand..."
- "What do you mean by..."
- "Paint me a picture..."

**NOT:**
- "Fill in this template..."
- "Complete this statement..."
- "Define your positioning..."

## Example

**Agent:** "Let's figure out how you'll position Källa Fordonservice - basically, how you'll explain what makes it special and who it's for. Start wherever feels natural: Who are your main customers? What makes you different from other garages?"

**User:** "We're the only game in northern Öland during summer. Everything with wheels - cars, buses, tractors, lawnmowers, motorhomes. Been here 20+ years, AutoExperten certified."

**Agent thinks:**
- ✅ Entry point: Differentiator (only option) + Breadth (all vehicles)
- ❓ Still need: Specific target customers, key benefit, what problem this solves
