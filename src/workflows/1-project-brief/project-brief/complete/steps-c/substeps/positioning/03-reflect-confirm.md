# Substep 3: Reflect & Confirm

## Task

Synthesize what you heard into positioning components and get user confirmation before creating final statement.

## Instructions

### 1. Synthesize Your Understanding

Present the positioning components you captured:

**Format:**
> "Here's what I'm hearing about your positioning:
>
> **Target Customer:** [who you heard]
> **Their Need:** [problem/opportunity you heard]
> **Product Category:** [how you'd categorize it]
> **Key Benefit:** [primary value you heard]
> **Alternatives:** [what people use instead]
> **What Makes It Different:** [differentiator you heard]
>
> Am I capturing this right? Anything to adjust or clarify?"

### 2. Handle User Response

**If user confirms:**
- → Proceed to Substep 4 (synthesize final statement)

**If user corrects:**
- Listen carefully to what they adjust
- Update your understanding
- Reflect back the correction: "Got it - so [corrected understanding]"
- Ask if that's better
- Once confirmed → Proceed to Substep 4

**If user says "I don't know" or seems uncertain:**
- Help them think through it: "Let's think about [component] - based on what you told me about [context], what would make sense?"
- Guide them to clarity, don't force a template answer

### 3. Document What Was Misunderstood

**For agent dialog `07-positioning.md`:**

In the Reflection Checkpoint section, record:
- Your synthesis (what you presented)
- Whether user confirmed or corrected
- **If corrected:** What you got wrong and what the actual answer was

**This creates a learning record for improving agent understanding quality.**

## Example

**Agent:** "Here's what I'm hearing about Källa Fordonservice's positioning:

**Target Customer:** Summer tourists and year-round locals in northern Öland who need vehicle service
**Their Need:** Quick, reliable help when vehicle breaks down - often uncertain if a garage can handle their specific vehicle type
**Product Category:** Full-spectrum auto service garage
**Key Benefit:** Peace of mind - comprehensive service for any vehicle type (lawnmowers to tour buses) from a trusted, certified provider
**Alternatives:** Garages in Borgholm, calling around to multiple shops
**What Makes It Different:** Only comprehensive option in northern Öland, handles ALL vehicle types, 20+ years experience, AutoExperten certified

Am I capturing this right?"

**User:** "Yeah, that's it. I'd say the main customers are actually more the locals year-round, but summer tourists are more visible because they're stressed."

**Agent:** "Got it - so year-round locals are primary, summer tourists are a distinct seasonal segment. Both matter, but locals are the core?"

**User:** "Exactly."

**Agent:** [Updates understanding, proceeds to Substep 4]

**Agent Dialog Update (`dialog/07-positioning.md`):**
