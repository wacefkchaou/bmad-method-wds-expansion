# Substep 2: Explore Positioning

## Task

Listen for signals and ask follow-ups until you capture all positioning components.

## Positioning Components (Fill These In)

- **Target Customer:** Who is this for?
- **Need/Opportunity:** What problem or opportunity?
- **Category:** What type of product is this? (helps set expectations)
- **Key Benefit:** What's the primary value?
- **Alternatives:** What do people use instead?
- **Differentiator:** What makes this different/better?

**Note:** You don't need to ask about these in order. Follow the natural flow of conversation.

## Conversational Follow-Up Patterns

Reference: `src/data/agent-guides/saga/conversational-followups.md`

### If They Mention TARGET CUSTOMERS

**Signals:** "For busy parents...", "Enterprise teams...", "Small businesses..."

**Follow-ups:**
- "What's typical for them? Walk me through their situation"
- "Why them specifically - what makes them the right fit?"
- "How do you know they have this problem?"

### If They Mention a PROBLEM or NEED

**Signals:** "People struggle with...", "Current solutions don't...", "They need..."

**Follow-ups:**
- "How do they handle this today?"
- "What happens when this goes wrong?"
- "Why hasn't this been solved already?"

### If They Mention ALTERNATIVES

**Signals:** "Unlike X...", "Better than...", "People currently use..."

**Follow-ups:**
- "What do people use today - what are the real alternatives?"
- "Why would someone stick with [alternative] instead of using yours?"
- "What can [alternative] do that you can't?"

### If They Mention DIFFERENTIATION

**Signals:** "We're the only...", "Our unique...", "Unlike others, we..."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Why does that matter to users?"
- "How long will that remain unique?"
- "Is that a real advantage or just a feature?"

### If They're VAGUE

**Examples:** "It's better...", "More convenient...", "Professional..."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Better how? Give me a specific example"
- "What does 'professional' look like to your users?"
- "Convenient compared to what?"

## Know When to Stop

You're ready when you can answer ALL of these:

- ✅ **Who:** Who is the primary target customer?
- ✅ **Need:** What problem/opportunity drives them?
- ✅ **Category:** What type of solution is this?
- ✅ **Benefit:** What's the key value they get?
- ✅ **Alternatives:** What do people use instead?
- ✅ **Differentiator:** What makes this better/different?

**Don't over-explore.** 10-15 minutes usually enough.

## Example

**User:** "We get tons of calls asking if we do X type of vehicle. We do EVERYTHING - lawnmowers to tour buses."

**Agent:** "So showing that range is important. Who typically needs that kind of breadth - locals year-round, or summer tourists?"

**User:** "Both, but summer tourists are stressed - car broke down, need help NOW, don't know if we can help their motorhome or whatever. They call everyone."

**Agent:** "What do they use if not you? Like, what are the alternatives in summer?"

**User:** "Garages in Borgholm maybe, but we're the main option in northern Öland. During summer we're basically it."

**Agent:** "And the benefit for them is...getting help fast? Knowing you can handle their vehicle type?"

**User:** "Yeah - peace of mind. We're certified, been here 20+ years, we'll figure it out."

**Agent thinks - Components Captured:**
- ✅ **Who:** Summer tourists + year-round locals (focus on tourists)
- ✅ **Need:** Vehicle breakdown, need immediate expert help, uncertainty about service availability
- ✅ **Category:** Auto service garage (broad spectrum)
- ✅ **Benefit:** Peace of mind - fast, reliable service for any vehicle type
- ✅ **Alternatives:** Garages in Borgholm, calling around to multiple shops
- ✅ **Differentiator:** Only comprehensive option in northern Öland, handles all vehicle types (lawnmowers→tour buses), 20+ years, AutoExperten certified

**Ready for reflection.**
