## Full Example (Källa)

**Vision statement:**
> "Create a professional web presence that clearly shows the breadth of our services - from lawnmowers to tour buses - to build credibility with summer tourists while filtering out calls we can't help with."

**Key insights documented:**
- Primary audience is summer tourists who need fast help (time-sensitive, stressed)
- Owner wants efficiency not growth - already at capacity
- AutoExperten certification is key trust signal
- Current phone calls are repetitive - website should answer common questions
- Service breadth (lawnmowers → tour buses) is unique selling point
