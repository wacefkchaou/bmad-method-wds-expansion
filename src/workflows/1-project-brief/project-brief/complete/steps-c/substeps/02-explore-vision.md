# Substep 2: Explore Vision

## Task

Listen for signals and ask follow-up questions until you capture the essence of what they're building.

## Instructions

### 1. Use Conversational Follow-Up Patterns

Reference: `src/data/agent-guides/saga/conversational-followups.md`

Listen for signals and respond:

**If they mention USERS:**
- "Tell me more about them - who are they?"
- "What frustrates them today?"

**If they mention BUSINESS VALUE:**
- "How do you see that translating to revenue/efficiency/growth?"
- "What would success look like in 6 months?"

**If they mention a FEATURE:**
- "What problem does that solve?"
- "Why is that important to you?"

**If they're VAGUE:**
- "Can you paint me a picture - what does that actually look like?"
- "Give me a specific example"

### 2. Know When to Stop

You're ready when you can answer:
- ✅ What are they building?
- ✅ Why does it matter?
- ✅ Who is it for?
- ✅ What makes it different?

**Don't over-explore.** 5-10 minutes usually enough.

## Example

**User:** "Tourists in summer drive me crazy - they break down and need help NOW."

**Agent:** "Tell me about the tourist situation - what time of year, what's typical?"

**User:** "Summer, June to August. Northern Öland, we're basically the only option. They break down, they're stressed, they call everyone. Half the time it's a car I can't take because we're full."

**Agent:** "So the website would help them understand if you can help them, before they call?"

**User:** "Exactly! And show we're legit - we're AutoExperten certified, been here 20 years."

**Agent:** "What about the 'basic stuff' calls you mentioned?"

**User:** "People asking if we do X type of vehicle. We do EVERYTHING. Lawnmowers to tour buses. I want that clear right away."

**Agent:** "Got it. So showing that breadth is important. How do you want to show it?"

**User:** "Maybe pictures of all the different types? So they see we're serious."

**Agent thinks:**
- ✅ What: Professional website showing service breadth
- ✅ Why: Reduce unnecessary calls, show credibility
- ✅ Who: Summer tourists (stressed, need fast answers)
- ✅ Different: Full range lawnmowers→tour buses, AutoExperten certified

**Ready for reflection.**
