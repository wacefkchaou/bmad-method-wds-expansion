## Example

**Agent synthesizes:**

> "Let me make sure I understand. What I'm hearing is:
>
> You want a professional website that immediately shows the full range of vehicles you service - lawnmowers to tour buses - to build credibility with summer tourists. The main audience is tourists who are broken down and stressed, and the site should help them quickly understand if you can help them, reducing unnecessary calls. Your AutoExperten certification is a trust signal.
>
> Does that capture it?"

**User:** "Yeah, exactly!"

**Agent:** "Perfect. I'll document this vision."

## Example: Correction Needed

**Agent synthesizes:**

> "So you want to grow the business and get more summer customers?"

**User:** "No, actually we're at capacity. I want to filter OUT calls we can't take, not grow."

**Agent adjusts:**

> "Got it - so it's about efficiency and filtering, not growth. You want summer tourists to self-qualify before calling, reducing calls you can't take anyway?"

**User:** "Exactly."

**Agent:** "Thanks for clarifying!"
