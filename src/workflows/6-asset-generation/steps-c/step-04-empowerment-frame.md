# Step 4: Frame User Empowerment

## STEP GOAL:

Apply Kathy Sierra's Badass Users framework to frame content around user capability and transformation — making users feel capable, showing their transformation path, creating "aha moments," and reducing cognitive load.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a strategic content analyst applying Badass Users methodology
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and identity, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring empowerment framing expertise, user brings their audience understanding
- ✅ Maintain a user-centric, empowering tone

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on empowerment framing — transformation, capability, cognitive load
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to generate content text in this step
- 💬 Reframe all feature-focused language to capability-focused language
- 📋 All five Badass Users principles must be addressed

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the Sequence of Instructions exactly
- 💾 Document empowerment framing in structured format
- 📖 Reference Badass Users principles data file when needed
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without transformation and capability framing defined

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Purpose (Step 0), VTC (Step 1), Awareness (Step 2), Action Filter (Step 3)
- Focus: Framing content around user capability, not product features
- Limits: Do not write content — define the empowerment frame for it
- Dependencies: Action Filter from Step 3

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Define Current vs. Badass State

Ask: **"What's the user's CURRENT state?"** — What are they struggling with? How do they feel?

Ask: **"What's their BADASS state after success?"** — What will they be able to do? How will they feel?

### 2. Identify the "Aha Moment"

Ask: **"What insight or realization will make them say 'Oh! I get it!'?"**

The aha moment is a perspective shift, not just understanding. It unlocks confidence.

### 3. Frame Around Capability

Ask: **"How do we frame this content to highlight THEIR capability, not our features?"**

Transform feature-focused language to capability-focused language:
- Before: "Our AI analyzes 10,000 sources"
- After: "You'll spot trends before your competitors"

### 4. Show the Transformation Path

Ask: **"How do we make the transformation visible and achievable?"**

Users need to see where they are, where they are going, and that the path is real and manageable. Use specific numbers, social proof, and quick wins.

### 5. Reduce Cognitive Load

Ask: **"Where might this content overwhelm or confuse?"**

Look for: too many choices, too much jargon, too many steps, unclear next actions. Identify what to simplify or cut.

### 6. Focus on Skills Over Tools

Ask: **"What skill or capability are we helping them develop?"**

Not "using our platform" but "staying current effortlessly" or "becoming the local authority."

### 7. Document Empowerment Frame

```yaml
empowerment_frame:
  transformation:
    current_state:
      description: "[Where user is now]"
      feelings: ["frustrated", "uncertain", "behind"]
      capabilities: "[What they can't do yet]"
    badass_state:
      description: "[Where they're going]"
      feelings: ["confident", "capable", "ahead"]
      capabilities: "[What they'll be able to do]"
    visibility: "[How we make the transformation visible and achievable]"
  aha_moment:
    insight: "[Key realization that shifts perspective]"
    why_powerful: "[Why this unlocks confidence]"
  capability_framing:
    - feature: "[Product feature]"
      reframed: "[What USER can do because of it]"
    - feature: "[Product feature]"
      reframed: "[What USER can do because of it]"
  cognitive_load:
    potential_issues:
      - issue: "[Where content might overwhelm]"
        solution: "[How we reduce load]"
    simplifications:
      - "[What we simplified or cut]"
  skill_focus:
    primary_skill: "[Main capability user develops]"
    supporting_skills: ["[Related capabilities]"]
    tools_secondary: "[Tools are means to skill, not the focus]"
```

### 8. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: **"Select an Option:** [C] Continue"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Save empowerment frame, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#8-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then end with display again of the menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN C is selected and the empowerment frame is documented will you load {nextStepFile} to begin determining structural order.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Current state clearly defined
- Badass state clearly defined
- "Aha moment" identified
- Content framed around user capability (not features)
- Transformation path visible and achievable
- Cognitive load issues identified and addressed
- Focus on skills gained, not tools used

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Generating content text in this step
- Leaving content framed around product features
- Not identifying the "aha moment"
- Skipping cognitive load analysis
- Not waiting for user input at menu

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
