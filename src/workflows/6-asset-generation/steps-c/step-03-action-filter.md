# Step 3: Define Required Action

## STEP GOAL:

Apply Action Mapping (Cathy Moore) to identify the specific action the user must be able to take after reading this content, and use that to filter what information is truly necessary versus nice-to-know fluff.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a strategic content analyst applying Action Mapping methodology
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and identity, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring action-focused filtering methodology, user brings domain context
- ✅ Maintain a sharp, purposeful tone — challenge anything that does not serve the action

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on identifying the required action and filtering information
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to generate content text in this step
- 💬 Push for specific behavioral actions, not vague "understanding"
- 📋 Challenge nice-to-know content that does not enable the action

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the Sequence of Instructions exactly
- 💾 Document the action filter in structured format
- 📖 Work backward from action to essential information
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without a specific action and information filter

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Purpose (Step 0), VTC (Step 1), Awareness Strategy (Step 2)
- Focus: What action must the user take, and what information enables it
- Limits: Do not write content — filter what information to include
- Dependencies: VTC and Awareness Strategy from previous steps

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Identify the Required Action

Ask: **"After reading this content, what must the user be able to DO?"**

Push for specific behaviors, not vague understanding:

**Good:** "Click the signup button with confidence" / "Choose the right pricing tier" / "Complete the first onboarding step"

**Bad:** "Understand our features" / "Learn about our company" / "Be aware of the benefits"

### 2. Connect Action to Business Goal

Trace the logic: User does [action] → which leads to [outcome] → which drives [business goal from VTC].

Ask: **"Does this action clearly serve the VTC's business goal?"**

### 3. Connect Action to Driving Forces

From VTC driving forces: **"By taking this action, how does the user move toward their wish or away from their fear?"**

### 4. Determine Essential Information

Work backward from the action:
- To do the action, the user must understand X
- To understand X, they need to know Y
- To know Y, we must tell them Z

Ask: **"What can we cut without preventing the action?"** Strip away everything else.

### 5. Identify Action Barriers

Ask: **"What might prevent the user from taking this action?"**

Common barriers: Confusion, Fear, Effort, Distrust, Irrelevance.

For each barrier, identify what content removes it.

### 6. Document Action Filter

```yaml
action_filter:
  required_action:
    description: "[Specific action user must be able to take]"
    success_criteria: "[How we know they can do it]"
  business_impact:
    connection: "[How this action drives the VTC business goal]"
    logic: "[Action → Outcome → Goal]"
  user_motivation:
    positive_driver: "[How action satisfies their wish]"
    negative_driver: "[How action addresses their fear]"
  essential_information:
    - "[Information element 1 — WHY needed for action]"
    - "[Information element 2 — WHY needed for action]"
    - "[Information element 3 — WHY needed for action]"
  cut_list:
    - "[Nice-to-know info that doesn't enable action]"
    - "[Impressive but irrelevant content]"
  action_barriers:
    - barrier: "[e.g., confusion about next steps]"
      solution: "[Content that removes this barrier]"
    - barrier: "[e.g., fear of commitment]"
      solution: "[Content that addresses this fear]"
```

### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: **"Select an Option:** [C] Continue"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Save action filter, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#7-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then end with display again of the menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN C is selected and the action filter is documented will you load {nextStepFile} to begin framing user empowerment.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Specific action identified (not vague "understanding")
- Action connects to VTC business goal
- Action satisfies user's driving forces
- Essential information determined (what enables the action)
- Unnecessary information identified (what does not enable action)
- Action barriers identified and addressed

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Accepting vague goals like "learn about us"
- Generating content text in this step
- Not challenging nice-to-know content
- Proceeding without a specific required action
- Not waiting for user input at menu

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
