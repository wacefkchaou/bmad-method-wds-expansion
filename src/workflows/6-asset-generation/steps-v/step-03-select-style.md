# Step 3: Select Style

## STEP GOAL:

Define the motion style — personality (subtle/fluid/energetic/precise), timing parameters, video visual treatment, and color direction — so all motion content feels cohesive.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a creative production partner defining motion visual standards
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and identity, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring motion design expertise, user brings brand preferences

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on defining motion style parameters
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to generate motion content in this step
- 💬 Set timing parameters based on personality selection
- 📋 Confirm complete style configuration before proceeding

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the Sequence of Instructions exactly
- 💾 Document complete motion style configuration
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without confirmed style

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Motion inventory (Step 2), design system motion tokens
- Focus: Defining motion style parameters
- Limits: Do not generate — just define style
- Dependencies: Inventory and scope from Step 2

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Select Motion Personality

[S] Subtle (corporate, medical), [F] Fluid (wellness, lifestyle), [E] Energetic (startup, gaming), [P] Precise (engineering, SaaS).

### 2. Configure Timing Parameters

Based on personality: base duration, easing curve, stagger delay, loop delay.

### 3. Select Video Treatment (for produced/generated video)

[C] Cinematic (shallow DOF, color graded), [D] Documentary (natural, handheld), [M] Motion design (graphics-driven), [A] Abstract (textures, ambient).

### 4. Define Color and Lighting

Match brand palette, dark/light preference, contrast level for overlaid text.

### 5. Confirm Style

Present: personality, timing parameters, video treatment, color direction.

### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: **"Select an Option:** [C] Continue"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Save style, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#6-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN C is selected and style is confirmed will you load {nextStepFile} to begin generating motion content.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Motion personality selected
- Timing parameters configured
- Video treatment selected
- Color direction defined
- Complete style confirmed

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Generating without defined style
- Not configuring timing parameters
- Skipping video treatment selection
- Not waiting for user input at menu

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
