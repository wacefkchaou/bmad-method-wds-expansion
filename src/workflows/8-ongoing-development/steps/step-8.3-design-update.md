# Step 8.3: Design Update

## Your Task

Design the incremental improvement - not a complete redesign, but a targeted update.

---

## Before You Start

**Ensure you have:**

- ✅ Completed step 8.2 (context gathered)
- ✅ Root cause identified
- ✅ Hypothesis formed
- ✅ Clear scope defined

---

## Kaizen Principle: Small, Focused Changes

**Remember:**

| DO ✅ | DON'T ❌ |
|-------|----------|
| Targeted improvement | Complete redesign |
| Change one thing well | Change everything |
| Incremental update | Big bang release |

---

## Design Process

### 1. Define What's Changing vs What's Staying

**Create:** `C-UX-Scenarios/XX-update-name/change-scope.md`

**See:** [substeps/design-templates.md](substeps/design-templates.md) for Change Scope template

---

### 2. Create Update Specifications

**For each screen/feature being updated:**

**File:** `C-UX-Scenarios/XX-update-name/Frontend/specifications.md`

**See:** [substeps/design-templates.md](substeps/design-templates.md) for Update Specification template

Key sections:
- Change summary (what's different from v1.0)
- Component changes (new, modified, removed, unchanged)
- Interaction changes (before/after)
- Copy changes with rationale
- Success metrics

---

### 3. Design New/Modified Components

**If you need new components:**

**File:** `D-Design-System/03-Atomic-Components/[Category]/[Component-Name].md`

**See:** [substeps/design-templates.md](substeps/design-templates.md) for New Component template

---

### 4. Create Before/After Comparison

**Visual documentation of the change:**

**File:** `C-UX-Scenarios/XX-update-name/before-after.md`

**See:** [substeps/design-templates.md](substeps/design-templates.md) for Before/After template

---

## Design Validation

**Before moving forward, validate your design:**

### Self-Review Checklist

- [ ] Does this solve the root cause?
- [ ] Is this the smallest change that could work?
- [ ] Does this align with existing design system?
- [ ] Is this technically feasible?
- [ ] Can we measure the impact?
- [ ] Does this create new problems?
- [ ] Have we considered edge cases?

---

### Hypothesis Validation

**See:** [substeps/design-templates.md](substeps/design-templates.md) for Hypothesis Validation template

---

## Next Step

After designing the update:

```
[C] Continue to step-8.4-create-delivery.md
```

---

## Success Metrics

✅ Change scope clearly defined
✅ Update specifications created
✅ New/modified components designed
✅ Before/after comparison documented
✅ Hypothesis validated
✅ Self-review complete
✅ Smallest effective change identified

---

## Failure Modes

❌ Scope creep (changing too much)
❌ Not documenting what's staying the same
❌ No before/after comparison
❌ Can't measure impact
❌ Creating new problems
❌ Not validating hypothesis

---

## Tips

### DO ✅

**Be surgical:** Change only what's necessary, keep scope tight

**Be clear:** Document what's changing AND what's staying

**Be measurable:** Define success metrics, set realistic targets

### DON'T ❌

**Don't scope creep:** "While we're at it..." ❌

**Don't redesign:** Complete overhaul ❌ → Targeted improvement ✅

---

**Remember:** Kaizen is about small, focused improvements that compound over time!
